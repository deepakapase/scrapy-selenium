        "description": "2-1/2 minute cook time. Excellent source of iron & calcium. Since 1893.  Wholesome Nutrition for Your Family: A hot delicious bowl of Cream of Wheat provides 6 essential vitamins and minerals including iron and calcium. Cream of Wheat is a naturally fat-free and cholesterol-free food that is also low in sodium when prepared with water and without salt. Calcium: Studies have shown that most Americans do not consume enough calcium through their diet, which may increase the risk of osteoporosis later in life. To help build and maintain strong bones and teeth, prepare a bowl of Cream of Wheat with 1-1/4 cup of fat-free milk. Add additional vitamins and minerals to your bowl by stirring in some fresh fruit and your favorite nuts. Iron: Your body needs iron to maintain energy levels and fight infection. But many people still do not get enough iron in their diet. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the United States. Just 1 serving of Cream of Wheat provides 50% of the iron needed to give you the energy to get you through your day!

Bring water and salt to a boil. (Or, if using milk, just bring to a boil.) 2. Gradually add Cream of Wheat, stirring constantly with wire whisk until well blended. 3. Return to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer uncovered 2-1/2 minutes or until thickened, stirring frequently. Cool slightly. 1 Serving: Water or Milk: 1-1/4 cups; Salt (Optional): 1/8 tsp; Cream of Wheat: 3 tbsp. 2 Servings: Water or Milk: 2 cups; Salt (Optional): 1/4 tsp; Cream of Wheat: 1/3 cup. 4 Servings: Water or Milk: 4 cups; Salt (Optional): 1/2 tsp; Cream of Wheat: 3/4 cup. Microwave Directions: 1 serving. 1. Mix 3 tbsp Cream of Wheat, 3/4 cup water or milk and a dash of salt in 1-quart microwaveable bowl or measuring cup. 2. Microwave on high 1 minute. Stir with wire whisk. Cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes or until thickened, stirring every 30 seconds. Stir again. Cool slightly. Caution: Bowl will be hot; carefully remove from microwave using pot holders. Note: Microwave ovens vary. Cooking times are approximate. Overheating can cause cereal to boil over. Tips for Best Results: When preparing with milk, watch carefully, stirring to prevent milk from boiling over. For thinner cereal stir in 1 to 2 tbsp additional hot water or milk for each serving. For thicker cereal, let stand a few minutes. Stir-In Ideas! Grandma's Original Gold Standard Molasses; Maple Grove Farms of Vermont Pure Maple Syrup; Polaner All Fruit; Fresh fruit such as strawberries, raspberries, blueberries or bananas. Infant & Toddler Use: Cream of Wheat makes a delicious food for infants age 6-12 months or toddlers. Discuss introduction of solid foods and the use of formula or milk in its preparation with your child's pediatrician. Cream of Wheat is easy to swallow, easy to digest and an excellent source of iron. Follow conventional directions using 1/2 cup water or milk and 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp Cream of Wheat, omitting salt. (Cereal will be very thick.) After cooking, stir in infant formula or milk to desired consistency and temperature.",

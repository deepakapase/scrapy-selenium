Minasis for Minas Gerais [mee-nas zher-ice], the biggest and we think best producing state located in the south-center of Brazil.\u00a0Naturais is Brazilian Portuguese for natural, the bean preparation method we most prefer in this part of the world.\u00a0Bean Preparation includes raking whole cherries continuously, and also on the trees, where a portion of the pickings are left to dry on the branch. Peet's Brazil Minas Naturais is smooth, full bodied and sun-dried sweet with natural notes of hazelnut.<br>The Peet's Promise: We believe there's only one way to roast coffee: with the precision of a craftsman who relies on his five senses - not a computer - to arrive at perfection. We believe coffee beans are at their peak the second they emerge from the roaster, so we quickly seal in the freshness to deliver you full flavor. We believe when we've done our job, you will experience something you've never tasted before - something uniquely rich and deep. The truth is, we don't believe in taking shortcuts and our approach to single cups has been no different. That's why Peet's can promise something you just can't get anywhere else: the uncompromised cup",

To start, use only the finest premium grade coffee. Buy coffee that is freshly roasted from a source you can trust. Use freshly drawn cold water.

We work with many family-run farms, and the relationships we've built over the years are essential to the quality and taste of our coffees. Using recipes perfected over four generations, we roast and blend these coffees to create the rich, smooth flavor you've come to expect time after time, cup after cup.  Our Family Story: Cap Saurage: Our founder. Our family is passionate about making great-tasting coffee. In 1919, my great-grandfather Cap Saurage discovered the secret of making our special coffee. He named it Community Coffee out of appreciation for his community of friends and the customers he served. Four generations later, our family is still active in selecting, roasting and perfecting great-tasting blends for coffee lovers everywhere.  Created for the finest restaurants, this welcoming, medium-dark roasted coffee has full-bodied flavor with a smooth and balanced finish. Made from only 100% select Arabica coffee beans. Imported, roasted, packed and distributed by Community Coffee Company, Baton Rouge, LA 70809.<br><br>Directions<br>2 tablespoons of ground coffee - for every 6 ounces of cold water. Store opened bags in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.",

The truth is, we don't believe in taking shortcuts and our approach to single cups has been no different. That's why Peet's can promise something you just can't get anywhere else: the uncompromised cup",

Today you'll discover aromas, fragrances, character, and complexity you never knew existed. Imagine what you will discover tomorrow. The Tully's Story: Some professionals need to approach their jobs slowly and with a great deal of care. Like tightrope walker. Or brain surgeon. Or tattoo artist. At Tully's , the same holds true for creating great coffee. It takes a lot of time and patience, which is why we roast our coffee beans to gently coax out the complex flavors and aromas. With roots in the Pacific Northwest, where coffee is a way of life, we take our time in roasting and in training each master roaster in our artisanal approach. From the aroma to the full-bodied flavor, you can taste the time taken in every satisfying cup of Tully's. Now we invite you to take your time discovering it. Made in the USA.<br><br>Directions<br>To unlock the full flavor of your cup of Tully's Coffee, we suggest the following: Water - Great coffee starts with fresh, cold, filtered water. Grind - Medium for automatic drip, coarse for French press, and fine for espresso. Measure - We recommend two level tablespoons for every six ounces of water. Share - Now that you can create a great cup of coffee, share it with your friends!",

Great coffee shouldn't be your only reward. Check out our website to see the wide variety of high quality accessories to compliment your Papanicholas experience. A family tradition since 1897! Our story is simple. For over 100 years and 5 generations, the Papanicholas family has worked to perfect the art and science of roasting coffee. Our founder, Nicholas A. Papanicholas, was a pioneer in bringing specialty roasted whole bean coffees into the grocery stores of Chicago in the early 1980's. Later, a gourmet line of flavored whole bean coffees was introduced to the delight of the coffee drinking public.  Freshness - Innovation - Quality - Tradition: These are the four cornerstones that Papanicholas coffee was founded upon. Together, with our partners around the globe, we continually strive to set the standard for coffee excellence. Based on these shared principles, we work tirelessly to deliver our mission statement: From the earth to the cup - give the world great coffee at a great value! - Nicholas A. Papanicholas. Bird friendly. Shade grown. Fair living wage. Roasted & packaged by Papanicholas Coffee Company.<br><br>Directions<br>Make the perfect cup of Papanicholas coffee. Whole Bean Coffee: Grind consistency is a very important variable in the coffee recipe - we suggest the following: Cone shaped filters - in-store grinder setting: fine home grinder: grind for 15 seconds. Flat Bottom Filters - In-store grinder setting: medium home grinder: grind for 10 seconds. French Press: In-store grinder setting: coarse home grinder: grind for 5 seconds. Ground Coffee: Papanicholas coffee has been ground to a medium consistency for use in most conventional auto-drip coffee makers. For best flavor and aroma, use 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 oz. of filtered water. To adjust the strength, simply add more hot water after brewing.",

Fair living wage.<br><br>Directions<br>Make the perfect cup of Papanicholas coffee. Whole Bean Coffee: Grind consistency is a very important variable in the coffee recipe, we suggest the following: Cone Shaped Filters: In-Store Grinder Setting: Fine. Home Grinder: Grind for 15 seconds. Flat Bottom Filters: In-Store Grinder Setting: Medium. Home Grinder: Grind for 10 seconds. French Press: In-Store Grinder Setting: Coarse. Home Grinder: Grind for 5 seconds. Ground Coffee: Papanicholas Coffee has been ground to a medium consistency for use in most conventional auto-drip coffee makers. For best flavor and aroma, use 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 oz. of filtered water. To adjust the strength, simply add more hot water after brewing.",

In 1827, the first coffee trees were planted in the Hawaiian Island in Manoa Valley on Oahu, from seedlings carried aboard the British Warship HMS Blond. Coffee trees were soon planted in the Kona District on the - Big Island -, Hawaii. The unique character of the Kona District with rich volcanic soil, mild island breezes, cool gentle rains, and afternoon shade provides the ideal conditions for coffee. Kona coffee's unique, rich in flavor and aroma caused it to become the favorite coffee of Hawaiian Royals. Royal Kona is the best of the best. We purchase our coffee cherries direct from the farmers to ensure that only the finest green coffee gets roasted to perfection by our Roast Master. We then pack our Royal Kona in a freshness valve bag to lock in the quality and flavor. Our goal is to have the best coffee in the world.<br><br>Directions<br>Now that you are using Royal Kona Coffee, the most important element of a great cup of coffee is the water. if your local water s high in mineral content or impurities a good choice is to switch to a quality bottled water. To brew use a French Press r a high grade drip coffee maker. For peak flavor add one tablespoon of ground coffee for every six ounces of cool water. Consume immediately after brewing. To preserve freshness, store in a cool dark place.",

        "description": "In 1828, the first coffee trees were planted in the Hawaiian Islands in Manoa Valley on Oahu, from seedlings carried aboard the British Warship HMS Blonde. Coffee trees were soon planted in the Kona District on the Big Island, Hawaii. The unique character of the Kona District with rich volcanic soil, mild island breezes, cool gentle rains, and afternoon shade provides the ideal conditions for coffee. Kona coffee's unique, rich flavor and aroma caused it to become the favorite coffee of the Hawaiian Royals. Royal Kona is the best of the best. We purchase our coffee cherries direct from the farmers to ensure that only the finest green coffee gets roasted to perfection by our Roast Master. We then pack our Royal Kona in a freshness valve bag to lock in the quality and flavor. Our goal is to have the best coffee in the world.<br><br>Directions<br>Now that you are using Royal Kona Coffee, the most important element of a great cup of coffee is the water. If your local water is high in mineral content or impurities a good choice is to switch to a quality bottled water. To brew use a French Press or a high grade drip coffee maker. For peak flavor add one tablespoon of ground coffee for every six ounces of cool water. Consume immediately after brewing. To preserve freshness, store in a cool dark place.",

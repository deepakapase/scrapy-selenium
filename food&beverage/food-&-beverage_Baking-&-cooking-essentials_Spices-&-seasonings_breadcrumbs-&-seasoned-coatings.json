Cooking Oil. About 1/2 cup Shore Lunch Original Recipe Fish Breading/Batter. 1 Box of Shore Lunch Original Recipe Breading/Batter coats about 5 pounds of fish. Use 4 eggs, beaten or 1 cup of milk when using the entire box. For Pan Frying:<br>1. Cut fillets into 4-inch pieces and pat dry.<br>2. Pour oil into a large skillet and preheat oil to 350 degrees F. Use a thermometer to ensure that the oil reaches 350 degrees F.<br>3. Place dry batter mix and egg or milk into separate shallow bowls.<br>4. For best results, moisten fish pieces in egg or milk and immediately dredge in dry batter mix, pressing to coat all sides thoroughly.<br>5. Carefully place fish pieces in preheated oil. Oil should cover fish pieces about halfway. Avoid overcrowding.<br>6. Fry each side until done, about 2-3 minutes, turning once. Fish is done when it flakes easily with a fork.<br>7. Remove cooked fish pieces from oil and drain on paper towels. For the crispiest texture, let fish stand for 1-2 minutes before serving. Enjoy! For Deep Frying: To deep fry fish, pour oil into a large Dutch oven or deep fryer to a depth that allows fish pieces to float while cooking. Dutch oven or deep fryer should be no more than 1/3 full of oil. Heat oil to 375 degrees F. Prepare fish as directed above and fry until done, about 3-5 minutes. Fish is done when it flakes easily with a fork. Drain on paper towels and let stand as above. Enjoy!",

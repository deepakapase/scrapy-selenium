Its natural moistness and true cane molasses flavor make it ideal in cookies, shortbread, spiced cakes, brownies and crumble toppings. <br><br>Storage<br>To retain moistness, brown sugar is best kept stored in an airtight container, away from light and heat. To soften brown sugar: Brown sugar will occasionally lose its natural moistness and become hard. To restore it, place in oven-proof container, cover and warm in 250 oven until soft - Or - in microwave container, heat on high, checking every 30 seconds. Sugar will be Hot! When soft, immediately measure desired amount. As sugar cools, it will harden.",

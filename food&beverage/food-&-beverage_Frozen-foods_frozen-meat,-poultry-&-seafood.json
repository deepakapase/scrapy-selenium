So it was only natural for her to mix a few spoonfuls of Amy\u2019s Chili with our Mac & Cheese at lunchtime. Soon others were doing the same, savoring the flavor and texture of the smooth, comforting mac & cheese combined with the slightly spicy chili. One day Irene gave some to Andy, and he loved it and decided that Amy\u2019s customers would as well. So here it is for you to eat and enjoy\u2026a delicious gluten free meal \u2013 another reminder that at Amy\u2019s, free from gluten does not mean free from flavor.",

Move oven rack to middle of oven. Heat oven to 400 degrees F. 2. Place fillets, seasoned side up, in a shallow metal baking pan. 3. Bake uncovered 14 to 16 minutes (fully cooked fish cuts easily with a fork and must reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees F or higher before serving). <br><br>Note: You may notice the salmon's natural white protein coming to the surface as it cooks, that is normal.<br><br>Microwave Oven (1100 watts): 1. Place fillets, seasoned side up, on a microwavable plate and cover loosely. 2. Microwave 1 fillet on High for 3 to 4-1/2 minutes (fully cooked fish cuts easily with a fork and must reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees F or higher before serving) or 2 fillets for 4-1/2 to 6 minutes (fully cooked fish cuts easily with a fork and must reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees F or higher before serving).

Heat oven to 375 degrees F. 2. Arrange frozen chicken on baking pan with sides. 3. Bake 45 to 50 minutes until chicken is fully cooked (Bake thawed chicken 35 to 45 minutes). Thawing: To thaw in microwave oven, arrange chicken in single layer on microwave-safe plate or baking dish. Cover loosely. Microwave on defrost (30% power) for 3 minutes. Rearrange and turn over chicken. Repeat microwaving and turning over, reducing time as chicken thaws and removing thawed pieces, until all pieces are no longer icy and can be easily pierced with a fork. To thaw in refrigerator, place bag in baking pan with sides and refrigerate 1 to 2 days. For best results when breading or marinating frozen chicken, remove the protective ice glaze by holding under lukewarm running water for about 1 minute. For food safety, cook to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F as measured a food thermometer. Appliances may vary; adjust cooking times accordingly. Refrigerate or discard leftovers immediately.

Do not refreeze.<br><br>Directions: For optimal food safety and quality, please be sure to follow these cooking instructions: Conventional Oven: Preheat to 400 degrees F. Place frozen fish in a single layer on a foil lined shallow baking pan. Bake for 24-28 minutes. <br><br>Microwave Oven: Place 2 frozen fillets in a single layer in a microwave dish. Cover loosely and cook on high power for 5 to 5-1/2 minutes. For best results, rotate once halfway through cooking. Allow your fish to sit covered for two minutes before serving. Caution! Hot! Hot! Hot! Steam can cause burns. Please use caution when removing the food from the microwave. <br><br>Finishing Sauce: Two ways to enjoy the finishing sauce: 1) Cold - Place sauce packet in refrigerator overnight, or place in cold water to thaw. Knead packet before opening. 2) Hot - Pour sauce from thawed packet into a microwave safe container and heat on high for 10 to 15 seconds. <br><br>Alternatively, pour sauce from thawed packet into a saucepan and heat over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle sauce over fish before serving. Bon appetit. <br><br>Note: Since appliances vary, be sure to cook to a minimum temperature of 165 degrees F before enjoying!

Don't mess with it until you see the juices on top, and don't press it! 3. Flip burger over and cook until the internal temperature reaches 161 degrees F (72 degrees C). 4. Put it on a bun or eat it like a steak. Either way, it'll be the best burger you ever ate! Bubba says, you may think cooking a frozen burger wouldn't be too tasty, but this thing is the tastiest burger you'll ever have - fresh or frozen! It is so tender that it will fall apart if you let it thaw. Trust me! Recommend medium setting or 325 degrees.

        "description": "No Name\u00ae Butcher quality since 1970. Tender cuts of boneless beef bottom sirloin, for an unforgettable steak-eating experience. Marinated for consistent No Name\u00ae flavor and juiciness, without MSG. Hand-trimmed, individually wrapped and quick frozen for  maximum freshness. MEAT WE'RE PROUD TO PUT OUR NO NAME\u00ae ON.<br>It all started in a Minnesota butcher shop in 1970. The neighborhood butchers spent many long hours envisioning, trimming and crafting the perfect hand-cut steak. Word quickly got around that those steaks cooked up tender and juicy.  A customer once asked a butcher what the steaks were called and he said, \"They don't have a name.\"<br>From then on, the No Name\u00ae steaks legend was in the books and meat lovers from near and far lined up outside the door and around the block to get their hands on those No Name\u00ae steaks.<br>Today, the same No Name\u00ae magic is stronger than ever with a variety of hand-cut, butcher-quality steaks, premium fish, Steak Burgers and even bacon. Whatever we do, you can be sure it's something special. Our butchers don't stop working until it's worthy of our No Name\u00ae.",

This product may be stored in your freezer until the use by date stamped on the end of the carton. For best results this product should be defrosted in the refrigerator prior to reheating. Meat products should not be allowed to stand at room temperature. Meat products should not be stored in the refrigerator for more than 3 days before reheating. Please follow our recommended heating instructions for food safety and for the most enjoyment of your Corky's Bar-B-Q Pork Ribs. Outdoor Grill: Preheat grill to medium-hot (350 degrees - 400 degrees F). Remove ribs from plastic pouch. Place ribs on grill away from coals or gas flame. Brush liberally with remaining bar-b-q sauce left in plastic pouch. Close grill cover and heat ribs for 15-20 minutes turning and basting ribs every 5 minutes. Heat until ribs are thoroughly hot and at least 165 degrees F. Microwave: Since microwaves vary, adjust cooking times accordingly. Remove ribs from plastic pouch. Cut rib slab in half and place both halves side by side (overlapping if necessary), on a microwaveable safe plate. Brush liberally with remaining bar-b-q sauce left in plastic pouch. Microwave at full power for 3 minutes. Remove plate from microwave. Rearrange ribs on plate and microwave again for an additional 2-3 minutes until ribs are thoroughly hot and at least 165 degrees F. Conventional Oven: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove ribs from plastic pouch. Put ribs on a foil-lined baking pan and brush liberally with remaining bar-b-q sauce left in plastic pouch. Put baking pan on middle shelf in oven. Bake uncovered for 30-35 minutes or until ribs are thoroughly hot and at least 165 degrees F. Refrigerate leftovers and use within 3 days. Use of a cooking thermometer is recommended. Use care when handling ribs after heating. Ribs will be very hot!

A rich, never bitter coffee experience. Gevalia has been refining the art of expertly crafted coffee since 1853 when our journey began in the small port town of Gavle, Sweden. Discover our 150-year pursuit of perfecting an exceptionally rich, never bitter taste. Passport Collection. Guatemala: Satisfy your taste for adventure and awaken your senses with the globally inspired Gevalia Kaffe Guatemala from the Passport Collection. Sourced exclusively from Guatemala, known for its majestic mountain ranges, the high altitudes strongly influence this single-sourced, medium-bodied coffee, with a depth and complexity of earthy, smoky notes and a hint of cocoa. This Gevalia coffee contains beans from farms that have achieved Rainforest Alliance certification, which encourages a minimum of 40% shade cover on farms located in naturally forested areas. Shade grown coffee is grown beneath a canopy of trees. The shade acts to prolong the bean maturation, which contributes to its complex flavors. Now you can experience the true taste of Guatemala in every rich, never bitter cup of Gevalia. Passport Collection: Explore the world sip-by-sip with a line of regionally sourced coffees from around the globe, expertly crafted to satisfy your taste for adventure.  <br><br>Directions<br>Open: Unfold the closure tabs, unroll the top and pull the bag apart. Close: Squeeze out the air, roll down the bag and fold the closure tabs. Store: Keep the unused coffee in a cool, dry place. For the Perfect Cup: To brew a delicious Gevalia cup at home, we recommend 1 slightly rounded tablespoon of ground coffee for each 6 fl oz cup of cold, filtered water. Adjust the recipe to suit your taste.",

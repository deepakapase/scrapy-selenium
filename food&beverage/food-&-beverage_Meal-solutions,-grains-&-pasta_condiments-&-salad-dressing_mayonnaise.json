We know that to really \"Bring Out The Best,\" we need to do more than just taste great. That's why our delicious Blue Ribbon Quality Mayonnaise is made with real eggs, oil and vinegar sourced from trusted American farms. Even after 100 years, we're still committed to using premium ingredients to craft the highest quality mayonnaise. It's simple. We use the finest, real ingredients in Hellmann's Real. In fact, we're on a mission to use 100% cage-free eggs and 100% responsibly sourced soybean oil by 2020, and we're proud to say we're already well on our way. Our authentic mayonnaise is rich in Omega 3-ALA (contains 650mg ALA per serving, which is 40% of the 1.6g Daily Value for ALA), and is also gluten-free and certified kosher.

Less than 1% of farmland in the U.S. is certified organic and transitioning from a conventional farm is a long, costly process. We created the Kashi Transitional Farming initiative so together we can help farmers transition their farmland to be organic. During the three-year conversion process, we\u2019re buying their transitional grains, which are certified by Quality Assurance International to ensure they are grown using sustainable practices that avoid genetically modified seed and synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. And we\u2019re proudly using them to make our new Non-GMO Project Verified Dark Cocoa Karma Shredded Wheat Biscuit Cereal. So although it\u2019s not organic, you can taste and feel the goodness.

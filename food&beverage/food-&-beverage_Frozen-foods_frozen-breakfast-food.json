Heat 1/4 cup oil in large skillet over medium-high heat or in electric skillet at 375 degrees F. 2. Carefully add frozen patties to form a single layer. 3. Fry 4 minutes; turn over. Fry 3 to 4 minutes longer until both sides are deep golden brown. 4. Drain on paper towels. Season to taste. Tip: When frying with oil, always preheat oil uncovered. If oil splatters, cover immediately and reduce heat. When splattering stops, remove cover and return to cooking temperature. Caution: Ice crystals will cause splattering when added to hot oil. Allow excess crystals to melt prior to frying. For food safety, cook to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F as measured with a food thermometer.

There are subtle but distinct advantages to stand-alone pouches: they\u2019re easier to open than their tin can cousins and they\u2019re re-sealable. Their smaller size means less loss of unused portions and less cupboard space to store them. What\u2019s more, the items chosen for this kit are among our customers\u2019 favorites for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and beverages. The kit includes 15 food pouches with 1,116 total servings and 202,960 total calories. There are (10) 4 gallon pails with up to a 20 Year Shelf Life! For over\u00a040 years\u00a0we have refined our recipes and sourced the finest ingredients to create the highest quality, long-term freeze dried and dehydrated meal solutions in the market. While most emergency food storage companies contract their production to outside manufacturers, we produce and package all\u00a0our\u00a0food from beginning to end. That means we can promise the\u00a0best quality\u00a0and\u00a0value\u00a0in the market. Make the wise decision and let Augason Farms give you a peace of mind that's as essential as it is delicious. Please discard oxygen absorber after opening. Best when stored in a cool dry place at temperatures between 55 and 70 Degrees F (ideal humidity 15%).",

        "description": "Only the best is branded Bar-S. Quality. Taste. Value. Satisfaction guaranteed. Great smoky flavor.<br><br>Directions:<br><br>Keep refrigerated. Cooking Suggestions: (Cook sliced bacon to 165 degrees F.) Skillet: Place separated slices in a cold frying pan. Cook slowly over a moderately low heat, turning slices occasionally. Allow 6 to 8 minutes cooking time. Pour off grease as it accumulates. When bacon is crisp, remove from pan and drain on paper towel. Bake: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lay separated slices on a rack in a shallow baking pan. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes until bacon is crisp. No turning is necessary. Microwave: Place separated slices on a double layer of paper towels in glass baking dish or on a microwave bacon dish. Cook on high for approximately 1 minute per slice. Cooking times may vary according to individual ovens. It is best to begin with the minimum amount of time, check often, and cook to the doneness you prefer. Broil: Preheat broil to 400 degrees F. Place separated slices on broiler pan rack. Cook bacon about 4 inches below heat, turning only once. Remove when bacon is cooked to desired crispness.

Organic farmers in this region are committed to preserving the beauty and richness of the land that is both their home and livelihood. Alma de la Tierra, Soul of the Earth, honors this worthy intention and the hard work required to realize it. <br><br>The Peet's Promise: We believe there's only one way to roast coffee: with the precision of a craftsman who relies on his five senses - not a computer - to arrive at perfection. We believe coffee beans are at their peak the second they emerge from the roaster, so we quickly seal in the freshness to deliver you full flavor. We believe when we've done our job, you will experience something you've never tasted before - something uniquely rich and deep. The truth is, we don't believe in taking shortcuts and our approach to single cups has been no different. That's why Peet's can promise something you just can't get anywhere else: the uncompromised cup",

We believe coffee beans are at their peak the second they emerge from the roaster, so we quickly seal in the freshness to deliver you full flavor. We believe when we've done our job, you will experience something you've never tasted before - something uniquely rich and deep. The truth is, we don't believe in taking shortcuts and our approach to single cups has been no different.

The signature taste and rich coffee character of French Roast comes from a longer, hotter roast, which not all beans can handle. For our darkest roast, we select only top-quality Arabica coffee from the highest altitudes of prime Latin American growing regions. Peet's French Roast is intensely bold and flavorful, with pronounced smoky overtones with a pleasant bite.<br><br>The Peet's Promise: We believe there's only one way to roast coffee: with the precision of a craftsman who relies on his five senses - not a computer - to arrive at perfection. We believe coffee beans are at their peak the second they emerge from the roaster, so we quickly seal in the freshness to deliver you full flavor. We believe when we've done our job, you will experience something you've never tasted before - something uniquely rich and deep. The truth is, we don't believe in taking shortcuts and our approach to single cups has been no different. That's why Peet's can promise something you just can't get anywhere else: the uncompromised cup",

At Tully's\u00ae, the same holds true for creating great coffee.   It takes a lot of time and patience, which is why we slow roast our coffee beans to gently coax out the complex flavors and aromas.  With roots in the Pacific Northwest, where coffee is a way of life, we take our time in roasting and in training each master roaster in our artisanal approach.  From the aroma to the full-bodied flavor, you can taste the time taken in every staisfying cup of Tully's\u00ae coffee.  Now we invite you to take your time discovering it.<br>True to a traditional French Roast, this full-bodied coffee reveals deep roasted aromas, and smoky flavors reminiscent of a quaint, Parisian caf\u00e9. The sophisticated finish highlights the coffee\u2019s sweet side and begs to be shared with a rich and chocolatey pastry.",

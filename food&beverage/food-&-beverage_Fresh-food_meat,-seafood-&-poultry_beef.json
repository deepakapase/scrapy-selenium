        "description": "Storage: Cooking Guidelines:<br>Directions: Oven: Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Arrange frozen chicken breasts in a single layer in a shallow roasting pan. Bake uncovered for 35 to 40 minutes, or until chicken can be easily pierced with a fork and juices run clear. Let stand 3 to 5 minutes before serving. Oven temperatures may vary. Adjust cooking times accordingly. Meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast should reach 170 degrees F. For pan frying in a skillet or grilling, thaw chicken first. Defrosting: For best results defrost chicken breast pieces in the refrigerator overnight. Always cook until the internal temperature reaches 170 degrees F. Skillet: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy skillet. Add thawed breast pieces and cook over medium high heat for approximately 4 to 5 minutes per side or until chicken can be easily pierced with a fork and juices run clear. Meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast should reach 170 degrees F Grill: Brush grill rack with cooking oil. Heat grill to medium-high. Place thawed breast pieces on grill rack. Cover and cook for 3 minutes. Turn breasts over and replace grill cover. Cook an additional 3 to 5 minutes or until chicken can be easily pierced with a fork and juices run clear. Meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast should reach 170 degrees F.

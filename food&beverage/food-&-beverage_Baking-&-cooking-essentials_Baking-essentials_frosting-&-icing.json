For a hard chocolate coating, refrigerate dipped treats on waxed paper-covered plate 10-15 min. or until chocolate is firm before serving. <br>Tips For Use: Heat slowly and stir. Overheating will cause chocolate to separate and become chunky. Separated chocolate cannot be salvaged. Make sure fruit and utensils are dry before dipping. Moisture will cause chocolate to clump together. Cover and refrigerate leftover chocolate and store up to 2 weeks. <br>To remelt, follow directions on the label.

Add red curry paste (Spice it How You Like: If you like it mild, use less curry paste, remove the dried chilies and add an extra 1/2 cup of water. If you like it hot, use all the curry paste and chop up the dried chilies before adding them) and cook, stirring, for about a minute until it starts to smell yummy. Step 2: Now's the time to pour in the creamy coconut milk and 1 cup water. Step 3: Stir through dried herbs and chilies (Spice it How You Like: If you like it mild, use less curry paste, remove the dried chilies and add an extra 1/2 cup of water. If you like it hot, use all the curry paste and chop up the dried chilies before adding them) and bring your curry back to the boil. Step 4: Drain and discard liquid from bamboo shoots. Add bamboo shoots, raw meat or seafood and vegetables. The whole lot will poach in your curry sauce to make it more flavorful! Simmer for 5-15 minutes or until your chosen additions are cooked through. Enjoy!",

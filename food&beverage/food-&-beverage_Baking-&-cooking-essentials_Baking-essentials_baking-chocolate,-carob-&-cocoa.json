Share the great homemade taste of The Original Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookie, America's Favorite Cookie Recipe! Good food, good life. <br><br>Directions<br>Melting: (visit VeryBestBaking.com for more melting tips) Microwave: Melt 1 cup (6 oz) morsels in uncovered, microwave-safe bowl on high (100%) power for 1 minute; stir. Morsels may retain some of their original shape. If necessary, microwave at additional 10- to 15-second intervals, stirring just until morsels are melted. To melt 2 cups (12 oz) morsels, microwave a few seconds longer. Double Boiler: Place morsels in top of double boiler over hot (not boiling) water. Do not cover. Prevent water from coming in contact with morsels. When most of the morsels are shiny, stir just until melted. Once melted, immediately remove top pan with melted morsels from bottom pan. For Dipped Fruit: melt 1 tbsp vegetable shortening and 1 cup (6 oz) morsels as directed above.",

To melt 2 cups (12 oz.) morsels, microwave a few seconds longer. Double Boiler: Place morsels in top of double boiler over hot (not boiling) water. Do not cover. Prevent water from coming in contact with morsels. When most of the morsels are shiny, stir just until melted. Once melted, immediately remove top pan with melted morsels from bottom pan. For Dipped Fruit: Melt 1 tbsp. vegetable shortening and 1 cup (6 oz) morsels as directed above.",

Gluten free. Collection Etienne Grand Cacao is a truly distinctive beverage, It's the kind of hot chocolate folks enjoyed in the 1920s, when Guittard was located at 139 Main Street in downtown San Francisco. Premium Collection Etienne chocolate, made from the best cacao beans, is finely ground and added into exquisite, old-fashioned, Dutch process cocoa powder. This truly artisan hot chocolate combines intense chocolate flavor, full bodied, creamy texture, rich, red-brown, dark chocolate color and comforting, homemade pudding-like, baked-chocolate aromas.  Made in a peanut and gluten free facility. Some settling of contents may occur during shipping.<br><br>Directions<br>Grand Cacao Substitutions: To substitute Grand Cacao for unsweetened Dutch process cocoa powder: replace unsweetened cocoa and an equal amount of sugar with Grand Cacao. For example, if the recipe calls for 1/2 cup Dutch process cocoa and 1 cup sugar, use instead 1 cup Grand Cacao (in place of 1/2 cup cocoa and 1/2 cup of the sugar) and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Preparation: For each serving, combine 4 tablespoons Grand Cacao and 1 cup milk in saucepan. Heat on medium-low with constant whisking until hot but not boiling. Pour into cups and serve immediately. Top with fresh whipped cream or, for an Aztec-style beverage, add a stick of cinnamon or a pinch of chili powder to the milk before warming. Alternatively, combine 4 tablespoons Grand Cacao and 1 cup milk in microwave safe mug. Heat on high for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes, stopping and stirring at 30-second intervals to dissolve hot chocolate.

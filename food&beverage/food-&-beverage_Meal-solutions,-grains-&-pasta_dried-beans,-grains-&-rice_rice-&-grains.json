Eat it plain or add chicken and vegetables to make a healthy and filling meal. <br><br><br>Directions:<br><br>Microwave:<br>1. Combine 1 cup brown rice and 3 cups water in a 2-1/2 quart microwave-safe dish. 2. Microwave uncovered on high for 10 minutes. 3. Reduce power to 50%, microwave uncovered for 20 minutes. 4. Allow rice to sit for 5 minutes. 5. Fluff with a fork and serve. Do not add salt or butter/margarine to the rice until after the rice is cooked. Note: These directions are based on cooking in an 1100 Watt microwave oven only. Cooking in a higher power microwave oven is not recommended. Cooking in a lower power microwave oven requires a longer time to cook. If your microwave does not have variable power settings follow manufacturer's directions. Brown Rice Storage: For longer shelf life we recommend storing brown rice in the refrigerator or freezer. <br><br>Stove top: <br>1. In saucepan, bring water to a boil (Cooking Measurement Chart: For drier rice, use 1 /4 cup less water. For moister rice, use 1/4 cup more water. 5 - 3/4 cup cooked servings = 1 cup rice, 2-1/2 cups water, makes 3-1/2 cups; 9 ; 14 - 3/4 cup cooked servings = 3 cups rice, 7-1/2 cups water, makes 10-1/2 cups). 2. Stir in rice (Add 1 tbsp tub margarine and 1 tsp salt per cup of uncooked rice, if desired). 3. Cover. Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes or until all water is absorbed.<br>For Cooking Rice in Excess Water: To prepare up to 2 cups of brown rice, bring 10 cups of water to a boil. Stir in rice. Return to a boil. Cook uncovered for 30 minutes. Drain water. Serve. 1 tablespoon tub margarine and 1 teaspoon salt per cup of rice can be added to the water while cooking, if desired.",

        "description": "Pillsbury Cake Mix1 cup of pudding in the mix. Makes 24 cupcakes<br><br>Directions<br>All You Need: Whole Egg Recipe: 1 cup water, 1/3 cup oil, 3 whole eggs. Egg White Recipe: 1-1/4 cups water, 1/3 cup oil, 4 egg whites. Get Ready: Set your oven to 350 degrees F. Prepare pan to keep cake from sticking by lightly coating bottom of pan with no-stick cooking spray or use shortening and a flour dusting. For Bundt cake coat the entire pan. For cupcakes use paper baking liners. Get Set: Blend cake mix, water, oil and eggs in a large bowl until moistened. Beat with a mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes or whisk by hand for 2 minutes. We recommend using Crisco Oil. Bake: Follow baking times below. When toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, your cake is done. To remove cake from pan, allow to cool 10 to 15 minutes before removing. Cool cake completely before frosting. Store loosely covered. Pan size - bake time: 13 x 9-inch - 32 to 36 min., two 8-inch round - 32 to 36 min., two 9-inch round - 27 to 31 min., bundt pan - 37 to 41 min., 24 cupcakes (2/3 full) - 18 to 22 min. Make your cake cholesterol-free by preparing cake as directed using 1-1/4 cups water, 1/3 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup egg substitute or 4 egg whites. For best results at high altitudes, add 1/4 cup flour. Follow basic recipe directions except for Whole Egg recipe, increase water to 1-1/4 cups.",

Simply substitute 1 cup flour with 1 cup Kodiak Cakes and omit salt and baking powder.

Do not over beat batter. For best results use batter within 15 minutes). Pour 1/4 cup batter on a preheated, lightly oiled griddle set at 375 F, or on a skillet set at medium. The griddle or skillet is ready when a drop of water spatters on the heated surface before evaporating. Flip flapjacks after bubbles stop forming and bottom side is golden brown (should take about one minute to cook first side, adjust heat accordingly). Cook opposite side until golden brown (should take about 30 seconds). Waffle Directions: To make about eight, 4 inch waffles blend or whisk: 1 cup mix; 1 cup cold water; 1 tbsp. oil (optional). Cook waffles on a preheated, lightly oiled waffle iron until steam stops and waffles are golden brown (waffle iron lid should lift without sticking).",

It's fudgy, delish, and easy to grab. <br><br>Directions<br>What You'll Need: 3 eggs + 1 tsp vanilla + 8 tbsp soft unsalted butter (You can also use a combination of oil and butter, coconut oil, or non-dairy substitute). For the most awesomely fudgy gluten-free brownies ever, follow these instructions carefully! Preheat oven to 325 degrees, for at least 10 minutes. Grease or spray a 8x8 metal pan. Melt one stick of butter and let cool. You can also use a combination of oil and butter, coconut oil, or non-dairy substitute. Empty the mix into a large bowl, add 3 eggs, 1 tsp. of vanilla and cooled butter. Stir to combine, batter will be thick and glossy. Spread into prepared pan. Bake 18-20 minutes, check brownies at 18 minutes. If using glass, bake 24-25 minutes. The edges should be firm to the touch but the middle will be soft, set but not firm. Insert toothpick in center of pan. Some crumbs should cling to the toothpick. If it comes out clean, you've likely over baked. Cool and enjoy.",

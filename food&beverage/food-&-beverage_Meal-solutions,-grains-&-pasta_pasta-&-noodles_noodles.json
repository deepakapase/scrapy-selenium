Serve with steamed rice.<br><br>Recipe Guide: Simply Add: 2 tbsp canola or vegetable oil; 1 lb thinly sliced boneless chicken breast or thighs, pork fillet or whole peeled shrimp; 1 egg, lightly beaten; 4 scallions, white and green parts finely sliced; juice of 1 lemon.<br><br>Directions<br>Step 1: Place Rice Stick Noodles in a large heat-safe bowl and cover with boiling water. Use a fork to stir and separate noodles. Leave to soak for 5-10 minutes or until softened. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water. Set aside for later. Step 2: In a large skillet or wok, heat oil over high heat. Add meat or shrimp and cook for 2-5 minutes or until cooked through. Push everything to one side of the pan or wok and add egg to the empty side. Let egg set for a minute until it starts to firm up. Now break up the egg and mix it through the meat/shrimp. Add softened rice stick noodles and Pad Thai Sauce into the pan. Use tongs to mix the whole lot together until well combined. Remove from heat and toss in the scallions and lemon juice. Enjoy!

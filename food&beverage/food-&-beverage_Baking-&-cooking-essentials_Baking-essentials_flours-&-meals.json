Washburn began operating his first flour mill, which produced far more barrels of flour than area bakers needed and was nicknamed \"Washburn's Folly.\" Fourteen years later, Washburn entered his flour at the first Millers' International Exhibition in Cincinnati, Ohio, where it took the \"Gold Medal\" grand prize as well as the name of its esteemed award. Today, Gold Medal flour is America's best-selling flour, making \"Washburn's Folly\" a success. Gold Medal still mills its own flour, just as it did over 125 years ago, blending the best premium hard and soft wheats from the heartland, providing the Gold Medal difference and consistency that home bakers have counted on for generations. Cups per Pound: There are 3-1/3 cups of flour per pound and about 6-2/3 cups per 2-lb. bag. There are 3-1/3 cups of flour per pound and about 17 cups per 5-lb. bag.",

Pillsbury Best All Purpose Flour is sifted over 100 times so it is appropriate for all recipes whether they call for sifted flour or not. However, shipping and storage may have caused settling of the flour so it is always a good practice to loosen the flour with a fork or spoon before measuring. What Flours Can I Substitute with All Purpose Flour? All Purpose and Unbleached All Purpose Flour can be used interchangeably. If the recipe calls for Self Rising Flour, simply add 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt for every cup of All Purpose Flour substituted in the recipe.",

Store flour in an airtight container in a cool place (75 degrees F or cooler) away from heat. For maximum shelf life, flour may be stored in refrigerator or freezer. If My Recipe Calls for Sifting, Do I Need to Sift? No! Pillsbury Best all purpose flour is sifted over 100 times so it is appropriate for all recipes whether they call for sifted flour or not. However, shipping and storage may have caused settling of the flour so it is always a good practice to loosen the flour with a fork or spoon before measuring. What Flours Can I Substitute with All Purpose Flour? All purpose and unbleached all purpose flour can be used interchangeably. If the recipe calls for self rising flour, simply add 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt for every cup of all purpose flour substituted in the recipe.",

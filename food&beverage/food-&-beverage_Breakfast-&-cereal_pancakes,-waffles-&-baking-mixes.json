Simply substitute 1 cup flour with 1 cup Kodiak Cakes and omit salt and baking powder. Flapjack Directions: To make about six, 4 inch flapjacks blend or whisk: 1 cup mix; 1 cup cold water (For thicker flapjacks, add less water; add more water for thinner flapjacks. Do not over beat batter. For best results use batter within 15 minutes). Pour 1/4 cup batter on a preheated, lightly oiled griddle set at 375 F, or on a skillet set at medium. The griddle or skillet is ready when a drop of water spatters on the heated surface before evaporating. Flip flapjacks after bubbles stop forming and bottom side is golden brown (should take about one minute to cook first side, adjust heat accordingly). Cook opposite side until golden brown (should take about 30 seconds). Waffle Directions: To make about eight, 4 inch waffles blend or whisk: 1 cup mix; 1 cup cold water; 1 tbsp. oil (optional). Cook waffles on a preheated, lightly oiled waffle iron until steam stops and waffles are golden brown (waffle iron lid should lift without sticking).",

        "description": "Famous since 1916. World famous recipe. Zero grams trans fat per serving. For over 95 years. In 1916, two young Polish immigrants named Nathan and Ida Handwerker put down their $300 life savings to open a frankfurter and french fry stand on Coney Island, New York. They called it Nathan's Famous! In addition to selling the country's newest taste sensation, the hot dog, Nathan and Ida served golden, crinkle cut french fries. Nothing like ordinary fries, these were made from fresh-peeled potatoes, cut thick and hearty with a unique, crinkly shape, and cooked to a crispy golden brown perfection. Today, Nathan's Famous hot dogs and crinkle cut fries are served the world over with exactly the same integrity and care. And now, you can enjoy the great taste of Nathan's Famous hot dogs and french fries right in your home! Questions or suggestions?

With quick, mouthwatering selections, Archer Farms appetizers make delicious snacks effortless and elegant.<br><br>Directions:<br>Heat & serve. Keep frozen. Keep frozen until ready to prepare. Pan Fry: Place unopened sauce packet in bowl of warm water for 10 minutes to thaw. Heat 1 Tbsp. Oil in large skillet over Medium-High for 1/2 package or 2 Tbsp. For entire package. Add frozen potstickers. Heat until bottoms are golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully add 1/3 cup water to skillet; cover. Heat until thoroughly heated, about 3 minutes. Turn potstickers and finish browning on all sides. Serve with dipping sauce. Microwave: Place unopened sauce packet in bowl of warm water for about 10 minutes to thaw. Place potstickers and 2 Tbsp. Water in microwave-safe casserole or dish. Cover. Microwave on HIGH 3 minutes. Stir gently to rearrange potstickers. Cover. Microwave 3 to 5 minutes longer until potstickers are hot throughout. Serve with dipping sauce. Appliances may vary; adjust times accordingly. Refrigerate or discard leftovers immediately. Tips from Our Test Kitchen: Make a Potsticker Soup: Heat 4 cups chicken broth, 2 cups fresh or frozen vegetables, sliced green onions and enclosed dipping sauce to boiling in medium saucepan. Add frozen potstickers. Simmer about 5 minutes until vegetables are tender and potstickers float. For extra flavor, add a few drops of fish sauce or sesame oil, minced fresh ginger or teriyaki sauce.",

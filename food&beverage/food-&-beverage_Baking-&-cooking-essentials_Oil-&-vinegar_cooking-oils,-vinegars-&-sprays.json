There are many avocado oil uses when cooking: baking, broiling, barbecuing, searing, saut\u00e9ing, stir-frying and more!<br>Conventional oil refining practices tend to remove most of the beneficial nutrients with the use of chemicals and heat. We are able to retain most of them with our natural refining process that does not require the use of chemicals or high heat. Virgin Avocado Oil has a smoke point of only 250 degrees Fahrenheit, which is too low for cooking. By gently removing the chlorophyll, waxes and sediments found in virgin avocado oil, we are able to achieve a versatile cooking oil with a mild flavor and high smoke point. Our natural refining process is so gentle and unique that we are able to retain 80% of the beta-sitisterol found in virgin avocado oil, as well as 60% of the vitamin E!",

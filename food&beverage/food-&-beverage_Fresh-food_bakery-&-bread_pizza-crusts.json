For 4 generations this Italian country heritage has resulted in products made with the highest quality ingredients gathered fresh from the fields. Now the Pastorelli family is proud to introduce a pizza crust as crisp and delicious as those found in the most authentic pizzerias. We hope you'll enjoy it along with our flavorful pizza sauce. Buon appetito! Made with flour specially milled to provide the nutrition of whole wheat with the taste and texture of refined flour.<br><br>Directions<br>Heating: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place pizza on the center rack and bake for approximately 6-10 minutes or until crust is golden brown on the edges and crisp underneath. For softer crust place pizza on baking sheet, for crisper crust place directly on oven rack. Longer cooking time may be necessary if using a baking sheet, pizza brick or unglazed terracotta tile. Check often as ovens may vary. To maintain freshness, refrigerate unused crusts after opening and freeze within 5 days.",

General Mills guarantees that every box of big G cereal has at least 8 grams of whole grain per serving (48 grams recommended daily). Grow up strong with big g kid cereals. 75% of kids don't get the recommended levels of calcium and vitamin d. At General Mills, we are committed to giving kids nutrients that will help them grow up strong! Calcium: calcium is critical to helping kids' bones and teeth grow strong. In fact, most bone growth occurs during childhood, so a calcium-rich diet is essential! Every serving of this cereal is a good source of calcium kids need. Vitamin D: all big g kid cereals are a good source of vitamin d, which helps kids absorb calcium to build and maintain strong bones. Keys to healthy living: eating a balanced diet moderate in calories and getting exercise are keys to a healthy lifestyle. A cereal breakfast is a simple step you can take. Research shows that people who frequently eat cereal have healthier body weights. Nutrition highlights: Key nutrients from the nutrition facts panel are featured so you can quickly see information important to you and your family. The nutrition highlights combined with the nutrition facts panel help you make informed choices. What are % daily values?: The % daily values (% DVs) are based on the daily value recommendations for a 2,000 calorie diet. DVs tell you if a food is high or low in a nutrient. Look for lower numbers in the first group; calories, saturated (bad) fat and sodium. Sugar does not have a DV. For key nutrients such as fiber, calcium and vitamin D, 10% is considered a good source.

Our Mission is Nourishing Lives: We guarantee your satisfaction with the quality of our products, and we are committed to nourishing lives, to protecting our environment and to giving back to our global communities. Still 5 Grains, Simply Gluten Free: The taste you love has always come with oats that are naturally gluten free. We're simply making sure they stay that way. It Starts with Family: When Phil, a member of the Cheerios team for over 50 years, found out his daughter-in-law couldn't eat gluten, he knew his team had to find a way to make sure every family, including his, could share breakfast together. Since oats are naturally gluten free, the only problem was finding a way to make sure they didn't get mixed up with anything else. What We Put In: Oats. What We Sort Out: Wheat, rye, barley. The Journey from Field to Bowl: Most of the farmers who grow oats for Cheerios also grow wheat and barley, which aren't gluten free. Sometimes, those grains get mixed together in the field or on the farm, so, to make Cheerios gluten free, we had to separate them. It took a lot of late nights and hard work, but we finally discovered a way to sort the other grains out of our oats. Cheerios for Everyone: We know there are lots of families out there who don't want to let dietary restrictions get in the way of spending time together. Now that Cheerios are gluten free, more families than ever can sit down to share breakfast, and we couldn't be happier. After all, bringing families together around the breakfast table is exactly why we're here. We swapped wheat and barley for sorghum and millet - and we think they make Multi Grain Cheerios even better. 18 g whole grain per serving. At least 48 g recommended daily.

Boost your breakfast even more by adding seeds or nuts for vitamin E, dried apricots for vitamin A, and citrus fruits for vitamin C.  Good source of fiber & made with whole grain.",

        "description": "Sweetened whole grain oat cereal with marshmallow pieces. Family friendly for four generations. No artificial flavors or preservatives. No high fructose corn syrup. No partially hydrogenated oil. Made with natural flavors. Whole Grain: 13 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily.  Eat the best, then do what's best! Carton made from 100% recycled paperboard. Minimum 35% post-consumer content. Carton printed with vegetable-based inks. Made using renewable wind energy. Nearly half of the world's oats are grown across the prairies of Canada. They're the world's largest exporter of oats up there, too. Oats, wherever they're grown, find their way into all kinds of foods - including many breakfast favorites. You're enjoying one right now! Canada's Pine Martens are related to otters, badgers and skunks. These cute little acrobats put the tails to work to make their way through the trees they call home. Arctic Hares are white and light gray from season to season. A Tundra Swan starts out like all of us do - as a baby. But that little bird grows up fast. In less than the first 90 days of its life, it grows 28 times larger than it was at birth. The tiny dark exceptions to their snow camouflage are how they survive Canadian winters. Black eyelashes protect their eyes from the sun's glare on the snow like sunglasses. How cool is that?  Simple Goodness Promise: We promise to make cereals that balance great taste, quality ingredients, and affordability. Mom's Best cereals contain no artificial flavors or preservatives, high fructose corn syrup, or hydrogenated oil. There's Better in Every Bowl: Minnesota-based, family-owned Mom's Best cereals has always been committed to being better for families and the planet - today and tomorrow. For four generations, we've considered future generations. Doing What's Right for Mother Earth: We're committed to showing Mother Earth the respect she deserves. That's why we purchase wind energy credits to offset 100% of the electricity used to make the cereal in this box. Our diligent recycling and water reduction efforts help conserve valuable natural resources for future generations. And this recycled paperboard box you're reading right now was printed using vegetable-based inks!  Quality Guarantee: If you're not happy with the quality of this product, contact us for a refund. All we need is a best if used by date and a proof of purchase.  Made in USA.",

Calculated for the following waste materials generated in 2011: packaging, dry ingredients, partially processed cereal, cereal dust, and ordinary trash. Between 2008 and 2011, our Utah plant reduced the amount of water needed to make each pound of cereal, saving more than 26 million gallons. That equals 62 football fields covered with a foot of water.  Quality Guarantee: Your purchase refunded or replaced if you are not satisfied. Best if used by date and proof of purchase required.  Try our Better Oats hot cereal. Why settle for ordinary hot cereal? We all deserve better! Better ingredients, better packaging and better for the planet. Better Oats is better hot cereal. Available in a variety of delicious flavors. Made in USA.",

Compare to Frosted Mini-Wheats (Frosted Mini-Wheats is a registered trademark of Kellogg North America Company) cereal. Resealable. 100% Whole Grain: 44 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily.  About 18 servings. Our best-selling cereal because it's spoons-down awesome! Twelve, yes twelve, delicious layers of biscuit goodness and 44 grams of whole grain in every serving. Baked to puffy perfection without saturated fat. Fortified with lots of vitamins and minerals. It's an all-family favorite! It's time to change the way you think about cereal. Great tasting cereal doesn't have to come in a box and it doesn't have to be expensive. That's why every variety of Malt-O-Meal brand cereal is less spendy, earth friendly, and soooo tasty. Less Spendy: We believe that families deserve a good deal. Quality food at a fair price. Every day. And in today's economy, who isn't looking for smart ways to spend their money? You'll be pleased to know that ounce for ounce, year after year, Malt-O-Meal brand cereals cost less than the expensively advertised boxed brands. Earth Friendly: Some people think cereal in a bag is just plain weird. But, think about it. Every year, the cereal industry produces 2.3 billion boxes, all unnecessary, because inside every cereal box is a bag full (if you're lucky) of cereal. That's just double packaging, in our opinion. In fact, our bags are 75% less consumer packaging waste to deal with than a comparably sized box with a bag inside (Based on the net weight of empty consumer packaging per pound of cereal delivered. So c'mon, help give the earth a break! Soooo Tasty: But, does it taste good? Will my family like it? Find out for yourself. We guarantee you'll love it or we'll give you your money back. Top our cereals with milk and some fresh fruit, or just have some on the side to make Malt-O-Meal brand cereal part of a wholesome, delicious breakfast.  TerraCycle: Make an eco-difference. This package can be recycled.  Taste Guarantee: We're sure your family will love our products! If you don't agree, your purchase will be refunded. Best if used by date and proof of purchase required.  Made in USA.",

Can help lower cholesterol (Three grams of soluble fiber daily from whole grain oat foods, like Apple Cinnamon Cheerios cereal, in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. Apple Cinnamon Cheerios cereal provides 0.75 grams per serving). Simply made. Gluten free. Grown. Milled. Toasted. No artificial flavors. No colors from artificial sources. See nutrition facts for as prepared information. A whole grain food is made by using all three parts of the grain. All General Mills Big G cereals contain more whole grain than any other single ingredient. Box Tops for Education. Same Cheerios, simply gluten free. The apple cinnamon you love has always come with oats that are naturally gluten free. We're simply making sure they stay that way. It Starts with Family: When Phil, a member of the Cheerios team for over 50 years, found out his daughter-in-law couldn't eat gluten, he knew his team had to find a way to make sure every family, including his, could share breakfast together. Since oats are naturally gluten free, the only problem was finding a way to make sure they didn't get mixed up with anything else. The Journey from Field to Bowl: Most of the farmers who grow oats for Cheerios also grow wheat and barley, which aren't gluten free. Sometimes, those grains get mixed together in the field or on the farm, so, to make Cheerios gluten free, we had to separate them. It took a lot of late nights and hard work, but we finally discovered a way to sort the other grains out of our oats. What We Put In: Oats. What We Sort Out: wheat; rye; barley. Cheerios for Everyone: We know there are lots of families out there who don't want to let dietary restrictions get in the way of spending time together. Now that Apple Cinnamon Cheerios are gluten free, more families than ever can sit down to share the taste of apple cinnamon, and we couldn't be happier. After all, bringing families together around the breakfast table is exactly why we're here. 15 g whole grain per serving. At least 48 g recommended daily.

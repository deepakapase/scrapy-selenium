Ready in just 4-5 minutes - it's the easiest way to please your family at dinner. Our Beginnings: Over 50 years ago, the Penn family moved their small family bakery from New York to Cleveland and continued to specialize in the crusty, chewy-textured, hearth-baked breads that are still popular in Europe today. Over time, the Penn family created the New York Brand line of Texas Toasts, Garlic Knots, Breadsticks, Garlic Loaves, and Ciabatta Rolls that have become favorites across the US. 100% recycled paperboard.<br><br>Directions:<br><br>Baking: Conventional Oven (For Crisper Crust After baking, place slices under broiler for 1-2 minutes): Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Remove bread from bag and separate slices. Place slices flat on baking sheet/aluminum foil. Bake 5-7 minutes on middle shelf of oven. To brown on both sides, turn slices over after 3 minutes. Toaster Oven (For Crisper Crust After baking, place slices under broiler for 1-2 minutes): Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Remove bread from bag and separate slices. Place slices flat on baking sheet/aluminum foil. Bake 4-5 minutes on middle shelf of oven. To brown on both sides, turn slices over after 2 minutes. Stove Top: Remove bread from bag and separate slices. Place slices in non-stick pan and cover. Heat at medium setting for 1-1/2 to 3 minutes on each side. On the Grill: Remove bread from bag and separate slices. Grill over medium coals for 1-1/2 to 3 minutes. Turn toast several times (15-30 second intervals). Serve warm. Keep frozen.",

Why are New York brand Garlic Breadsticks the original? In 1920, the Penn Family moved their small bakery from New York to Ohio. After successfully selling frozen garlic bread under the New York brand name, someone suggested making individual garlic breadsticks. Our breadsticks are coated with our special garlic blend and topped with real, shredded Parmesan cheese. They'll melt in your mouth. Try them along side any of your favorite meals, soups or salads. Our competitors also discovered what great products they are. But don't be fooled! Ours is the Original and the best!<br><br>Directions:<br>Baking: Remove breadsticks from bag.

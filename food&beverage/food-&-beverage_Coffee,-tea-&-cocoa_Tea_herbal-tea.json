It\u2019s the inner bark of this tree that is actually called \"slippery elm\" due to its, yes, slippery, smooth, and slimy-in-a-good-way properties.

It's no wonder that people throughout Europe have been cultivating and using it for thousands of years both to support digestion and to calm a jangled nervous system.

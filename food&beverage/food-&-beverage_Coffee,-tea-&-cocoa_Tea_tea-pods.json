Reason to love : retaining water can make you feel heavy, swollen and waterlogged. Probably the last thing on your mind is to drink tea or add more water to the situation. But actually, this tea contains diuretic herbs which have traditionally been combined to help your body eliminate excess water and return you to a more comfortable condition. A blend of fennel, parsley, red clover, uva ursi, cleavers and chicory, as well as cranberry and hibiscus, we love the tart, fruity taste of this tea nearly as much as we love its ability to relieve water retention.

The robustness from these regions is complemented by the softer and more subtle teas from China and Indonesia. The combination of these varieties yields a complex, full-bodied, lively cup of tea that is perfect any time of day.",

Reason to love: while your bundle of joy is probably causing you no end of delight, moms can also feel overwhelmed and tired, especially when it comes to breastfeeding. We love the fact that this herbal tea has traditionally been used to help mothers support their production of breast milk and to promote healthy lactation. With herbs like fennel, anise (which give the tea a sweet, licorice like taste), coriander and fenugreek, each sip is like stepping into a tradition that has been passed down from woman to woman for hundreds of years.

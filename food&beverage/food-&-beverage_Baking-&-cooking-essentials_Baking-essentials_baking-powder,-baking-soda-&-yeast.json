If your gravy, sauce or soup recipe calls for flour, replace with half as much corn starch. Dissolve in cold water before adding to hot liquids. Mix corn starch with a little cold water until smooth, then gradually stir into hot liquid. Stir until it boils; boil one minute. Try one of two sauces for Chinese cooking. For stir-fry, add a mixture of corn starch, soy sauce or salt, vinegar and water at the last stage. For dishes cooked longer over low heat, thicken at the last minute with corn starch and water.",

Heat about 1/4 inch of vegetable oil in large, heavy skillet over Medium heat to 350 degrees F. Oil is ready when bread cube is dropped in oil and turns brown on the bottom in 20 seconds.

Add dozen pieces at a time to bag or pan. Close top of bag and shake well or roll in pan to coat all pieces evenly. Discard any remaining coating mix.

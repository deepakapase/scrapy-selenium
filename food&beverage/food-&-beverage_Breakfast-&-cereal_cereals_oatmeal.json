High fiber. Good source of protein. Dairy & casein free. Non GMO Project verified. nongmoproject.org. We Make People Happy: It all started in the small bakery of a natural foods market on Main Street in Glastonbury, Connecticut. I listened to my celiac customers' concerns about the taste of many of the gluten free options available to them, and thought that no one should have to suffer because of a food allergy or other special dietary need. And so my mission became to create all products that would make my customers happy. Today, that mission has expanded to not only make our customers happy with great-tasting gluten free products, but spreading a little bit of happiness to everyone we meet and work with. I'd also like to encourage you to think about the things that make you happy, and to do something to make yourself, a family member, a friend or even a complete stranger happy. Now our bakery is bigger, but we still bake in small batches. We hope you love our products as much as we love creating them for you. Thank you! - Michael Smulders, Founder. This box is made from 100% recycled fibers and is 100% recyclable. Would you expect anything less from the makers of 100% delicious oatmeal? Made in USA.",

Excellent source of iron. 220 calories/serving; 2.5 g total fat; 4 g total fiber; 5 g protein. Did you know? We only buy certified gluten free oats. We test for gluten at 10 ppm. We do not blend our oats with barley or rye. Did you know? 100 grams of whole rolled oats, steel cut oats and old fashioned oats have the same nutritional values. Grains offer the most fiber.

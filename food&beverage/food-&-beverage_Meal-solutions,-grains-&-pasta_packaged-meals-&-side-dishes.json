When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official \"rabbit of approval\" representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products.  Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 AM, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac & cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office busy. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now, Annie.  We work with trusted suppliers to source only non-GMO ingredients.  Family Farms...grow the organic wheat and raise the organic cows to make flour for our macaroni and to produce milk for our cheese to make your meal wonderfully wholesome & delicious!",

Add your favorite cheeses, meats & vegetables to create pizzas your family will love.<br><br>Directions:<br>1. Preheat oven to 425 degree F. Pour crust mix from both pouches (or prepare 1 crust with 1 pouch and 2/3 cup very warm water. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil, and follow steps 2-4 on single pizza pan or cookie sheet) into a medium bowl. Stir in 1-1/3 cups very warm water with fork; mix until completely moistened and dough forms into a loose ball. Drizzle 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over dough. Turn to coat entire surface with oil. Cover loosely with plastic wrap; let stand in a warm place for 5 minutes (may increase stand time to 20 minutes for a more pliable dough and lighter baked crust). 2. Spray two 12-in pizza pans - or - two cookie sheets with no stick cooking spray (May substitute a light coating of vegetable oil for cooking spray). Divide dough in half placing each piece in the center of selected pans. For pizza pan - using hands, spread dough to edge; pinch edge to contain sauce. Repeat with other pan. For cookie sheet - using hands, shape dough into a 14 in x 10 in rectangle; pinch edge to contain sauce. Repeat with other pan. 3. Spread half of pizza sauce evenly on each piece of dough to within 1/2 inch of edge. Open cheese pouch; sprinkle evenly over sauce. Personalize pizza by adding favorite toppings - cheese, vegetables or other cooked meat, if desired. 4. Place prepared pizzas on the lowest two racks in oven. Bake for 10 minutes; rotate pans in oven. Bake for another 10 - 12 minutes or until crust in golden brown. For a Thick Crust Pizza: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Spray 13 x 9-inch glass baking pan with no-stick cooking spray. Using hands, spread dough into bottom of pan. Spread sauce evenly over crust. Top with cheese. Bake for 22-24 minutes or until bottom crust is golden brown.",

Stir together Seasoning and Crouton Blend, oil and cold water in medium bowl. Set aside. 3. Drain pasta. Rinse with cold water; drain well. Stir pasta into seasoning mixture. Serve immediately, or refrigerate. (Croutons will soften as salad stands. If desired, stir in additional oil, 1 teaspoon at a time, to moisten refrigerated salad). Refrigerate leftovers. For Creamy Caesar Salad, make as directed - except stir together Seasoning and Crouton Blend, 1/3 cup mayonnaise and 1 to 2 teaspoons milk (instead of the vegetable oil and cold water). <br><br>Microwave: Fill 2-1/2-quart microwavable casserole dish (with handles) with 4 cups hot water. Pour Pasta into hot water, stir. Microwave uncovered on high 12 to 15 minutes or until pasta is tender (microwave times may vary). Caution: Dish will be very hot. Continue as directed in steps 2 and 3 above. Stir-In Ideas: Stir any of the following into your finished salad: for a refreshing side dish, add 1 cup chopped fresh vegetables; for a lighter meal, add 2-1/2 cups cut-up cooked chicken, ham, turkey or roast beef, 1/2 cup quartered grape or cherry tomatoes, 2 cans (6 oz each) tuna, drained, or 1-3/4 cups shredded cheese.",

Use a fork to stir and separate noodles. Leave to soak for 5-10 minutes or until softened. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water. Set aside for later. Step 2: In a large skillet or wok, heat oil over high heat. Add meat or shrimp and cook for 2-5 minutes or until cooked through. Push everything to one side of the pan or wok and add egg to the empty side. Let egg set for a minute until it starts to firm up. Now break up the egg and mix it through the meat/shrimp. Add softened rice stick noodles and Pad Thai Sauce into the pan. Use tongs to mix the whole lot together until well combined. Remove from heat and toss in the scallions and lemon juice. Enjoy!

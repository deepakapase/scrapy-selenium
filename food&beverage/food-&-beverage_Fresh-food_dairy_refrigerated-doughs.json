The Toll House cookie was born! In 1939, Nestle created the Toll House Morsel.<br><br>Directions:<br>Keep refrigerated. Unbaked dough may be frozen for up to 2 months if frozen before use by date on the package. Prior to baking, thaw in refrigerator for 5 hours, then bake as instructed. Do not refreeze.

Cool on baking sheets for 2 mins; remove to wire racks to cool completely. High Altitude: Bake at 350 degrees F for 12 to 13 mins.",

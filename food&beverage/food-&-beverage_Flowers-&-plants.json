Their beauty, diversity, extended season of bloom, graceful stature and overall reliable disposition reflect the fruits of hundreds of years of selective breeding. In Chinese, the word \"Lily\" means \"forever in love\". The lilium family is so large, varied, and complex that it is challenging to describe them in short. Lilies are deer and critter resistant. Plant just about anywhere - borders, beds, cutting gardens, perennial gardens, pots and containers.  Stargazer lilies are very fragrant and are probably the best known of all lilies. These florist quality lilies have outward facing bowl shaped blooms, producing 6-8 flowers per stem. They are sturdy and long lasting, growing into impressive plants.",

Developing a gently spreading habit as it matures, this compact evergreen is the ideal shrub for nearly any landscape application. Its petite foliage emerges yellow-green before maturing to a rich green shade, and its tiny white blossoms emerge in spring. In fall, ornamental red fruits develop, adding late-season interest to the landscape. Dwarf Yaupon tolerates drought and salt spray better than most shrubs, making it ideal for dry climates and coastal areas.

In Chinese, the word \"Lily\" means \"forever in love\". The lilium family is so large, varied, and complex that it is challenging to describe them in short. Lilies are deer and critter resistant. Plant just about anywhere - borders, beds, cutting gardens, perennial gardens, pots and containers.  Best Buy lily mixture! As this is a true lily mixture, no two packs are exactly the same.

If you have been to a state fair, you have probably seen a pavilion filled with these exotic amazing blossoms. Collected by many gardeners, they make for sturdy varietal plants and are excellent in perennial borders. Growing them will likely lead to a hobby as the spectacular blooms are addictive and quite versatile in the garden. They can also be grown as pot plants. A gardening expert once said of dahlias, \"Never have so many enjoyed so much with so little time and work\". He was right! Plus, they are inexpensive. It is also the national flower of Mexico.  This award winning variety produces huge flowers.",

Sedums are also commonly known as Stonecrop. A very dependable choice for the garden that offers foliage interest early in the season and a colorful flower display later.  Sedum Black Beauty produces superb, deep purple to blackish foliage, and excellent branching produces full plants, with masses of reddish-pink flower heads in late summer. Heat and drought tolerant, they will grow in nearly any soil.",

Developing a gently spreading habit as it matures, this compact evergreen is the ideal shrub for nearly any landscape application. Its petite foliage emerges yellow-green before maturing to a rich green shade, and its tiny white blossoms emerge in spring. In fall, ornamental red fruits develop, adding late-season interest to the landscape. Dwarf Yaupon tolerates drought and salt spray better than most shrubs, making it ideal for dry climates and coastal areas. Please refer to the zone map above for recommended planting dates for your location. Includes one Dwarf Yaupon 'Schillings Dwarf\u2019 in a 2.25 gallon pot.",

If you have been to a state fair, you have probably seen a pavilion filled with these exotic amazing blossoms. Collected by many gardeners, they make for sturdy varietal plants and are excellent in perennial borders. Growing them will likely lead to a hobby as the spectacular blooms are addictive and quite versatile in the garden. They can also be grown as pot plants. A gardening expert once said of dahlias, \"Never have so many enjoyed so much with so little time and work\". He was right! Plus, they are inexpensive. It is also the national flower of Mexico.  Thomas Edison is an all-time favorite due to its lavish blooms, which are 9 inches across.",

These spring-flowering perennial hardy orchids are quite durable in a wide range of garden conditions. If you have always thought hardy orchids were difficult to grow, then give Bletilla a try. Bletilla flowers are somewhat reminiscent of the popular house plant Orchid Dendrobium, only they are smaller. In the wild, this hardy orchid grows in semi-wooded conditions, in the shade of tall grass meadows, and along the edge of forests. In the garden, feel free to plant them in a partial sun spot with moist, well drained soil.  Bletilla striata, also commonly called Chinese Ground Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid that produces cattleya-like pink, purplish flowers atop papery-textured sword-shaped pale, green leaves.",

They can be grown in beds, borders, in containers for cut flowers, and even indoors in a sunny window. Great for growing in a cutting garden and showing off indoors in your nicest vases. For the look and feel of a tropical garden in North America, calla lilies definitely fit the bill, as their trumpet-shaped spathes and arrow-shaped leaves transport you to the tropics. Best of all, they are deer and rabbit resistant.  Passion Fruit callas produce large blooms atop tall stalks in a tropical looking peach color. Flowers are good for cutting and have a long vase life. The rhizomes (bulbs) will multiply, if zone appropriate, through offsets.",

Woody perennials are whose above ground parts persist over winter, while herbaceous perennials are non-woody plants that die back to the ground each winter. However, the roots survive the winter and the plants re-sprout in the spring. This collection is the herbaceous type, which make them high value plants that will return for years to come with little to no effort.  This high value perennial collection provides tons of color for little money for years to come and combines four varieties that can be either planted together as pictured, or scattered throughout the garden. The roots are individually packaged and labeled so that you can use them as you wish. Included are the following best bet perennials: Salvia Maynight, Heuchera Obsidian, Hemerocallis Stella D'Oro, and Hosta Aureomarginata. These perennials are vigorous growers, thriving in hot sunny planting sites and are heavy re-bloomers. Tons of color for little money for years to come. Salvia was the Perennial Plant of the Year in 1997, Daylily Stella D'Oro is the most valued and popular in the world, while the hosta and heuchera add foliage beauty more beautiful then flowers.",

Their great reedy canes and palmy foliage make for large, magnificent plants, yielding blooms all summer long for long lasting curb appeal. They are deer resistant and appear most dramatic when grouped in masses. These are fast growers with large flowers.  Canna Phasion can eventually grow as tall as seven feet, making it one of the largest growing cannas available, producing large, deep orange flowers in summer and fall. What makes them truly a stand out is their striking, multi-colored foliage. With leaves that are more beautiful than flowers, they start out green, bronze-purple with pink stripes that age to shades of pink and orange. Thought to be a mutation of Canna Wyoming, it is a quick multiplier and vigorous grower.",

Sedums are also commonly known as Stonecrop. A very dependable choice for the garden that offers foliage interest early in the season and a colorful flower display later.  Sedum Herbstfreude is also known as sedum Autumn Joy and is a most popular garden succulent. This hardy, upright variety sports light green leaves and deep rose flowers that age to a beautiful bronze later in the growing season. These tall upright Sedums form large clumps of foliage that add a considerable dimension in the garden landscape as its massive flower heads burst into color in fall. If left standing - which is what we recommend - they provide much winter interest and food for birds. A very valuable plant!",

The lofty spires on our Hollyhock plants are covered with large, frilled flowers in stunningly beautiful colors. Typically biennial, allow the seeds to fall, and the clump will persist and return for years to come. They are Royal Horticultural Society prize winners! They bloom for weeks and make for a great back drop and tall garden dividers. Plant several packs to create that mass color effect. Twenty four plants will give you an 18 to 27 foot color wall in your garden. Wow!  Hollyhocks are a must have for the cottage garden and produce a luscious mixture of various colors.",

They tolerate less then ideal conditions and will bloom faithfully for years with virtually no attention. As the name implies, daylily flowers open in the morning and die by nightfall. Each flower stem typically has at least a dozen flower buds, and the plant stays in bloom for many weeks. They should be planted in every garden.  Happy Returns distinguishes itself with its profuse bloom and compact size, which makes it a good choice for containers.",

Growing them will likely lead to a hobby as the spectacular blooms are addictive and quite versatile in the garden. They can also be grown as pot plants. A gardening expert once said of dahlias, \"Never have so many enjoyed so much with so little time and work\". He was right! Plus, they are inexpensive. It is also the national flower of Mexico.  Lots of variety and color, with each mixture being unique. Results are best when grouped or mass planted in sunny areas.",

Woody perennials are whose above ground parts persist over winter, while herbaceous perennials are non-woody plants that die back to the ground each winter. However, the roots survive the winter and the plants re-sprout in the spring. This collection is the herbaceous type, which make them high value plants that will return for years to come with little to no effort.  Geranium Rozanne are also known as simply Hardy Geranium. They produce large blooms and attractive foliage. Most effective when grown in groups in borders, containers, or rock and cottage garden, so buy several for maximum effect. Rozanne is better than the older varieties, blooming for weeks and sometimes even months.",

It is prized for its flavor, is rich in vitamins and minerals, and is only 30 calories per cup. Compare this to the grocery price of fresh Asparagus, and you can easily justify the effort of growing your own. Fun Fact: 12 crowns should provide enough fresh asparagus for one person for the season. Plant more if you are planning on freezing or canning the spears.  Mary Washington is a heirloom (1919) variety, and the parent stock of many of the more modern hybrid varieties. It's known to be uniform in size, resistant to asparagus rust and to have a fuller flavor. This open-pollinated variety will reproduce from female flowers in your growing bed, making more and more plants over the years. These plants will grow forever and ours are GMO Free.",

They are somewhat more expensive to propagate, but well worth their cost and you should think of them as an investment in your garden. Double peonies, which is what these are, are by far the most popular of all peony types and the most widely planted.  Van Zyverden produces this special all-in-one mixture - kind of a pot luck, fun and full of surprises. As each mixture is guaranteed to be unique, buy several packs to plant in masses, and create that dramatic, bold, curb appeal. A Best Buy peony mixture!",

While non-flowering, they are grown for their green deciduous fronds that provide dramatic effect. The familiar \"fiddleheads\" emerge from the base of the plant and unfurl into large, erect, yellowish-green, sterile fronds that remain attractive throughout summer. The common name of this plant is in reference to the cinnamon colored fibers found near the frond base. Fun fact: Osmunda fiber used in the potting of orchids comes from the roots of these ferns.  Excellent selection for wet areas along ponds, streams, water gardens or bogs. Also grows well in shaded borders, woodland gardens, wild gardens or native plant gardens.",

Their beauty, diversity, extended season of bloom, graceful stature and overall reliable disposition reflect the fruits of hundreds of years of selective breeding. In Chinese, the word \"Lily\" means \" forever in love\". The Lilium family is so large, varied, and complex that it is challenging to describe them in short. Lilies are deer and critter resistant. Plant them just about anywhere - borders, beds, cutting gardens, perennial gardens, pots and containers.  The true name of this variety is Flore Pleno. It most closely resembles a double tiger lily. This mid-summer bloomer produces double blooms and is a heirloom variety, making it an excellent choice for lily collectors and lovers.",

In Chinese, the word \"Lily\" means \"forever in love\". The lilium family is so large, varied, and complex that it is challenging to describe them in short. Lilies are deer and critter resistant. Plant just about anywhere - borders, beds, cutting gardens, perennial gardens, pots and containers.  Our Tequila Sunrise Lily Blend consists of a mixture of large, flowering, oriented lily varieties. They are showy, fragrant, strong, and very grand in the garden.",

It is often known by the common name Flanders Poppy. This red beauty creates a carpet of color when massed.",

Their beauty, diversity, extended season of bloom, graceful stature and overall reliable disposition reflect the fruits of hundreds of years of selective breeding. In Chinese, the word \"Lily\" means \"forever in love\". The lilium family is so large, varied, and complex that it is challenging to describe them in short. Lilies are deer and critter resistant. Plant just about anywhere - borders, beds, cutting gardens, perennial gardens, pots and containers.  This Oriental lily blend blooms mid to late summer, being the last of the lilies to bloom. They produce a spicy fragrance and are known as Jewels Of The Garden. Oriental Fragrant Blend is one of our best-known lily blends.",

Typically biennial, allow the seeds to fall, and the clump will persist and return for years to come. They are Royal Horticultural Society prize winners! They bloom for weeks and make for a great back drop and tall garden dividers. Plant several packs to create that mass color effect. Twenty four plants will give you an 18 to 27 foot color wall in your garden. Wow!  This double pink bloomer was chosen for our collection for its brilliant, clear-pink color. It is a great choice for a cottage garden, adding romance and calm.",

        "description": "Calla (Zantedeschia) lilies are extraordinary flowers, are native to Southern Africa, and are grown from rhizomes. They can be grown in beds, borders, in containers for cut flowers, and even indoors in a sunny window. Great for growing in a cutting garden and showing off indoors in your nicest vases. For the look and feel of a tropical garden in North America, calla lilies definitely fit the bill, as their trumpet-shaped spathes and arrow-shaped leaves transport you to the tropics. Best of all, they are deer and rabbit resistant.  The purple in this Akela variety is a true, royal purple that also has faint streaks of cream. As it is a mini-dwarf hybrid, it does not grow as tall as some of the other calla lilies, making it an excellent choice for containers on a patio and/or deck.",

Plant them just about anywhere - borders, beds, cutting gardens, perennial gardens, pots and containers.  Due to their limited height, Pixie lilies are a good choice for smaller pots. They are easy and fun to grow. Orange is the most popular lily color.",

Typically biennial, allow the seeds to fall, and the clump will persist and return for years to come. They are Royal Horticultural Society prize winners! They bloom for weeks and make for a great back drop and tall garden dividers. Plant several packs to create that mass color effect. Twenty four plants will give you an 18 to 27 foot color wall in your garden. Wow!  Cr\u00e8me de Cassis was chosen for our collection for its striking, contrasting colors.

For the look and feel of a tropical garden in North America, calla lilies definitely fit the bill, as their trumpet-shaped spathes and arrow-shaped leaves transport you to the tropics. Best of all, they are deer and rabbit resistant.  This unique calla variety, Indian Summer, produces fantastic burgundy blooms that are bi-colored beigey-gold to the lower outer petal, that sit atop arrow shaped blue-green, smooth textured foliage. The stamens are yellow, and the stems are bright green. This calla variety is a very reliable flower.",

Growing them will likely lead to a hobby as the spectacular blooms are addictive and quite versatile in the garden. They can also be grown as pot plants. A gardening expert once said of dahlias, \"Never have so many enjoyed so much with so little time and work.\" He was right! Plus, they are inexpensive. It is also the national flower of Mexico.  Dahlia The Phantom is a Anemone-flowered type dahlia. It is a new addition to our dahlia availability and one of the most admired dahlias.

If you have been to a state fair, you have probably seen a pavilion filled with these exotic amazing blossoms. Collected by many gardeners, they make for sturdy varietal plants and are excellent in perennial borders. Growing them will likely lead to a hobby as the spectacular blooms are addictive and quite versatile in the garden. They can also be grown as pot plants. A gardening expert once said of dahlias, \"Never have so many enjoyed so much with so little time and work\". He was right! Plus, they are inexpensive. It is also the national flower of Mexico.  Aloha produces striking red and yellow tropical and exotic flowers.",

It is prized for its flavor, is rich in vitamins and minerals, and is only 30 calories per cup. Compare this to the grocery price of fresh Asparagus, and you can easily justify the effort of growing your own. Fun Fact: 12 crowns should provide enough fresh asparagus for one person for the season. Plant more if you are planning on freezing or canning the spears.  Jersey hybrid varieties often produce the highest yields, much greater then older varieties and are disease tolerant. This variety also does well in warmer climates.

Growing them will likely lead to a hobby as the spectacular blooms are addictive and quite versatile in the garden. They can also be grown as pot plants. A gardening expert once said of dahlias, \"Never have so many enjoyed so much with so little time and work\". He was right! Plus, they are inexpensive. It is also the national flower of Mexico.

These tender bulbs, which are commercially cultivated in the sub tropics of Florida and Brazil, love and require warmth, and are easy to grow and maintain. They are known for their lush contrasting edges, veins and multi-colored tropical foliage, even though they produce white flowers. They are best grown grouped in the garden.  Pink Symphony is a lance leaf type caladium that produces vibrant, bright pink leaves. Sun exposure and fertilization will affect the color.",

Not only are they one of the largest flowering bulbs but they are also very versatile and can grow with little sunlight to full shade. Beautiful on their own or planted as a back drop for your favorite blooms, they provide a bold tropical effect in nearly any garden. Grown for only their foliage which are reminiscent of an elephant's ears. Once established they require little to no attention.  These giant upright Elephant Ears come from the alocasia family and are known for their leaves, which point in an upward direction. This most impressive variety grows somewhat larger than our traditional Elephant Ears. Their leaves are huge, leathery thick, sculpted on rigid stems. These plants will make a passersby stop in their tracks. In native areas, under ideal conditions, the plants have reached 10 feet in height. Easy to grow and magnificent!",

        "description": "Grow your own eversweet strawberries in a stylish, high quality, cosmopolitan, modern 12 inch hanging basket. Strawberries are fairly easy to grow, and there is nothing like a fresh berry plucked off your own plant. Strawberries are ideal for growing in a hanging basket since they are small plants with shallow root structures. Additionally, since the fruit does not touch the soil, fruit health is greatly improved. Our eversweet variety is easy to grow and bears delicious yummy fruit all summer long, unlike some others that only produce in June or spring. This variety is heat tolerant and produces large, flavorful berries. Plant, water, feed and pluck these berries and fill your own mouth with the unbeatable aroma of home grown strawberries.  Our kit comes with a 12 inch diameter hanging planter, an 18 inch hanger, compressed soil and 6 bare root strawberry plants instead of seed. Seed takes too long to produce and roots guarantee success. Instructions on how to expand the soil and plant the basket are included as well. Even though three strawberry plants will fill up this container, we have included three extra, so that you have extra plants to play around with in another container of your choosing.",

Beautiful on their own or planted as a back drop for your favorite blooms, they provide a bold tropical effect in any garden. Once established, they require little to no attention.  The proper and complete botanical name of this variety is Colocasia esculenta 'Mojito'. This is a very unique and newer variety, named after the popular Cuban drink. Its green leaves are set off by dark spots and purple stems. The speckles and streaks vary from leaf to leaf, so no two leaves are ever quite the same. A real thriller in the garden, adding surprise and interest. The leaves are 8-14 inches in length and width.",

Lea & Perrins combines the finest ingredients sourced from around the world and ages them in perfection to produce a flavor unmatched for over 175 years. The Famous Paper Wrap: In 1837, Lea & Perrins first began exporting worcestershire sauce around the world by boat. The lengthy and often rough sea voyages caused some of the bottles to break. The practice of wrapping each bottle in a paper wrap was devised to protect the bottles and prevent damage during transit. Although no longer technically necessary, the custom has endured, and the paper wrap has come to symbolize the rich heritage and premium quality of Lea & Perrins, a tradition dating back to 1835. Cholesterol free. Fat free. Gluten-free. No preservatives. 80% less sodium than soy sauce (Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce contains 65 mg of sodium per 1 tsp. serving. The top national brand of regular soy sauce contains 310 mg of sodium per 1 tsp). <br><br>Directions<br>Best if used by date on bottle. Shake the bottle.",

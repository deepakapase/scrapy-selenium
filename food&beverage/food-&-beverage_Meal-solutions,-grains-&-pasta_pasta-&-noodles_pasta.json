Cook uncovered, stirring frequently, for 10 to 11 minutes. 5. Drain pasta. 6. Top with sauce and your meal is ready. <br><br>Storage tips: <br><br>Refrigerate leftover pasta in a re-sealable food storage bag. Open bag slightly and reheat in microwave oven, checking at 15 second intervals, until pasta is heated through.

Enriched with niacin, ferrous sulfate (iron), thiamine, riboflavin, folic acid Anthony\u2019s is glad to help make a meal you\u2019re proud to serve. Always tasty never sticky.<br><br>Directions: <br>1. Bring 4 quarts of water to a rapid boil. 2. Add Anthony's Salad Macaroni and stir. Be sure to use at least 4 quarts of water for cooking each pound of pasta. There should be enough water so the pasta tumbles freely as it cooks. Adding salt and vegetable oil to the cooking water is not necessary, but is a matter of personal taste. 3. Return water to a rapid boil. 4. Cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, for 7 to 9 minutes. 5. Drain pasta. 6. Top with sauce and your meal is ready. You do not need to rinse the pasta unless the recipe specifically says to do so. If making pasta into a cold salad, rinse with cold water.<br><br>Storage tips: <br><br>Refrigerate leftover pasta in a re-sealable food storage bag. Open bag slightly and reheat in microwave oven, checking at 15 second intervals, until pasta is heated through. Because pasta will absorb flavors and oil from sauces, leftover cooked pasta and sauce should be stored separately.",

Always tasty never sticky.<br><br>Directions: <br>1. Bring 4 quarts of water for each lb of pasta to a rapid boil. Adding salt and vegetable oil to the cooking water is not necessary, but is a matter of personal taste. 2. Add Anthony's Spaghetti and stir. Be sure to use at least 4 quarts of water for cooking each pound of pasta. There should be enough water so the pasta tumbles freely as it cooks. 3. Return water to a rapid boil. 4. Cook uncovered, stirring frequently, for 10 to 11 minutes. 5. Drain pasta. 6. Top with sauce and your meal is ready. <br><br>Storage tips: <br><br>Refrigerate leftover pasta in a re-sealable food storage bag. Open bag slightly and reheat in microwave oven, checking at 15 second intervals, until pasta is heated through. Because pasta will absorb flavors and oil from sauces, leftover cooked pasta and sauce should be stored separately.",

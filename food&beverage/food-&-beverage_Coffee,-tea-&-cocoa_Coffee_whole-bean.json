The signature taste and rich coffee character of French Roast comes from a longer, hotter roast, which not all beans can handle. For our darkest roast, we select only top-quality Arabica coffee from the highest altitudes of prime Latin American growing regions. Peet's French Roast is intensely bold and flavorful, with pronounced smoky overtones with a pleasant bite.<br><br>The Peet's Promise: We believe there's only one way to roast coffee: with the precision of a craftsman who relies on his five senses - not a computer - to arrive at perfection. We believe coffee beans are at their peak the second they emerge from the roaster, so we quickly seal in the freshness to deliver you full flavor. We believe when we've done our job, you will experience something you've never tasted before - something uniquely rich and deep. The truth is, we don't believe in taking shortcuts and our approach to single cups has been no different. That's why Peet's can promise something you just can't get anywhere else: the uncompromised cup",

Caf\u00e9 Domingo is smooth and balanced, with hints of toffee sweetness and a crisp, clean finish.<br>The Peet's Promise: We believe there's only one way to roast coffee: with the precision of a craftsman who relies on his five senses - not a computer - to arrive at perfection. We believe coffee beans are at their peak the second they emerge from the roaster, so we quickly seal in the freshness to deliver you full flavor. We believe when we've done our job, you will experience something you've never tasted before - something uniquely rich and deep. The truth is, we don't believe in taking shortcuts and our approach to single cups has been no different. That's why Peet's can promise something you just can't get anywhere else: the uncompromised cup",

Our small contributions have had an enormous effect on the families, the community, and the coffee itself.

Great coffee shouldn't be your only reward. Check out our website to see the wide variety of high quality accessories to compliment your Papanicholas experience.  A family tradition since 1897! Our story is simple. For over 100 years and 5 generations, the Papanicholas family has worked to perfect the art and science of roasting coffee. Our founder, Nicholas A. Papanicholas, was a pioneer in bringing specialty roasted whole bean coffees into the grocery stores of Chicago in the early 1980's. Later, a gourmet line of flavored whole bean coffees was introduced to the delight of the coffee drinking public.  Freshness - Innovation - Quality - Tradition: These are the four cornerstones that Papanicholas coffee was founded upon. Together, with our partners around the globe, we continually strive to set the standard for coffee excellence. Based on these shared principles, we work tirelessly to deliver our mission statement: From the earth to the cup - give the world great coffee at a great value! - Nicholas A. Papanicholas. Bird friendly. Shade grown. Fair living wage. Roasted & packaged by Papanicholas Coffee Company.<br><br>Directions<br>Grind consistency is a very important variable in the coffee recipe - we suggest the following: Cone shaped filters - in-store grinder setting: fine home grinder: grind for 15 seconds. Flat Bottom Filters - In-store grinder setting: medium home grinder: grind for 10 seconds. French Press: In-store grinder setting: coarse home grinder: grind for 5 seconds. Ground Coffee: Papanicholas coffee has been ground to a medium consistency for use in most conventional auto-drip coffee makers. For best flavor and aroma, use 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 oz. of filtered water. To adjust the strength, simply add more hot water after brewing.",

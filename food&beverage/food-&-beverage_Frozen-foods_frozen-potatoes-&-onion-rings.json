In 1916, two young Polish immigrants named Nathan and Ida Handwerker put down their $300 life savings to open a frankfurter and french fry stand on Coney Island, New York. They called it Nathan's Famous! In addition to selling the country's newest taste sensation, the hot dog, Nathan and Ida served golden, crinkle cut french fries. Nothing like ordinary fries, these were made from fresh-peeled potatoes, cut thick and hearty with a unique, crinkly shape, and cooked to a crispy golden brown perfection. Today, Nathan's Famous hot dogs and crinkle cut fries are served the world over with exactly the same integrity and care. And now, you can enjoy the great taste of Nathan's Famous hot dogs and french fries right in your home! Questions or suggestions?

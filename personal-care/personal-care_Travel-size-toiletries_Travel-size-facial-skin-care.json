This will help keep skin looking healthy and beautiful. Makeup, along with dead skin cells, dirt and pollution can cause our pores to become clogged and may lead to breakouts and skin dullness. We understand the impact that products and the environment have on our skin, yet when at the gym, traveling, out and about on hot days, and even long days or late nights, can make cleansing with a face wash an undesirable task. This is when the convenience of cleansing facial wipes cannot be denied. Pond's Original Fresh Wet Cleansing Towelettes are gentle, textured cleansing cloths. No other leading cloth is better at removing impurities and makeup. Infused with Vitamin E and a Triple Anti-Oxidant complex, these disposable cleansing and make up removal wipes revitalize your skin while leaving it perfectly clean and makeup free.

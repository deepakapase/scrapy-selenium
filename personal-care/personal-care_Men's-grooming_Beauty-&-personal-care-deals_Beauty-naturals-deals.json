Integrating lip care into sun care with beneficial including coconut oil and shea butter. Created by and for surfers (and all their friends who love to play and be in the sun and salt water). Scented with natural coconut for a true beach vibe- no matter where your adventures may happen. What else you should know: Remember, your sunscreen only works if you use it correctly! Shake this can well as it contains suspended minerals that you need for best results. Apply liberally to all exposed skin. SPF numbers are determined in a lab. In the real world, no matter what the SPF, sunscreens start to lose effectiveness over time (2 hours max). So it's important to reapply every two hours or less and after swimming or heavy sweating. The most important factor is that you need to use enough sunscreen for adequate protection. And while our sunscreens apply evenly and can have a more translucent look, they work as a block and you need to cover your skin completely for effective results. What else you should know: Every true beauty knows it's what's on the inside that matters.Formulated without petroleum, parabens, silicones, retinyl palmitate, phthalates & chemical UV absorbers.Directions. Sun damage is serious and sunscreens are only effective if you use them properly!",

Shake this can well as it contains suspended minerals that you need for best results. Apply liberally to all exposed skin and rub in with your hands for an even coverage.

An opaque bronze tint should be expected with this product for best results.What else you should know: Every true beauty knows it's what's on the inside that matters.Formulated without petroleum, parabens, silicones, retinyl palmitate, phthalates & chemical UV absorbers.Directions.

Invisible patches disappear on skin and stay in place even while you sleep. <br><br>The Alba Botanica\u00ae\u00a0brand was born in 1979 and follows a simple mission - to Do Beautiful.

Goes on smoothly so it doesn't tug too hard and pull on your delicate areas. Scented with natural coconut for a true beach vibe- no matter where your adventures may happen. Created by and for surfers (and all their friends who love to play and be in the sun and salt water).What else you should know: Remember, your sunscreen only works if you use it correctly! SPF numbers are determined in a lab. In the real world, no matter what the SPF, sunscreens start to lose effectiveness over time (2 hours max). So it's important to reapply every two hours or less and after swimming or heavy sweating. The most important factor is that you need to use enough sunscreen for adequate protection. And while our sunscreens apply evenly and can have a more translucent look, they work as a block and you need to cover your skin completely for effective results. What else you should know: Every true beauty knows it's what's on the inside that matters.Formulated without petroleum, parabens, silicones, retinyl palmitate, phthalates & chemical UV absorbers.Directions. Sun damage is serious and sunscreens are only effective if you use them properly! Sun protection measures. Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer & early skin aging. To decrease this risk, regularly use a sunscreen with a broad spectrum SPF value of 15 or higher & other sun protection measures including: Limit time in the sun, especially from 10 am - 2 pm. Wear long-sleeve shirts, pants, hats, and sunglasses when in the sun.WarningsFor external use only. Do not use:On damaged or broken skin. Stop use and ask a doctor if rash occurs. When using this product, keep out of eyes. Rinse with water to remove. Keep out of reach of children. If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away. Can stain clothing. Keep away from clothes.Sun protection measures. Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer & early skin aging. To decrease this risk, regularly use a sunscreen with a broad spectrum SPF value of 15 or higher & other sun protection measures.",

Integrating lip care into sun care with beneficials including coconut oil and shea butter. Created by and for surfers (and all their friends who love to play and be in the sun and salt water). Everyone deserves the best ingredients, the best performance and the best scents. What else you should know: Remember, your sunscreen only works if you use it correctly! Shake this can well as it contains suspended minerals that you need for best results. Apply liberally to all exposed skin. SPF numbers are determined in a lab. In the real world, no matter what the SPF, sunscreens start to lose effectiveness over time (2 hours max). So it's important to reapply every two hours or less and after swimming or heavy sweating. The most important factor is that you need to use enough sunscreen for adequate protection. An opaque tint should be expected with this product, as it is a block and you need to cover your skin completely for effective results. What else you should know: Every true beauty knows it's what's on the inside that matters.Formulated without petroleum, parabens, silicones, retinyl palmitate, phthalates & chemical UV absorbers.Directions. Sun damage is serious and sunscreens are only effective if you use them properly!",

Declining levels of Vitamin C make skin tissue less flexible and resilient and slows down the repair and synthesis of collagen. Ester C\u00ae is the most stable and effective form of Vitamin C, and in our special serum it goes to work immediately. Antioxidants are a group of compounds that deactivate single oxygen molecules, more commonly referred to as free radicals. Antioxidants bind with the free radicals before it can join with a healthy cell. This protects the skin cells against oxidative damage. They are essential to good health and are found naturally in many fruits and vegetables. Free radicals are the natural by-products of many processes within and among cells. They can also be caused by exposure to environmental stresses, including pollution, smoking and UV rays. A free radical has an unpaired electron, which makes it very unstable. Once the oxygen molecule loses an electron, it tries to stabilize itself by taking another electron from a healthy molecule. If left unchecked, free radicals can cause major damage to healthy cells. Using products rich in antioxidants will help slow the oxidative damage done to cells by free radicals. Ester C\u00ae is the stabilized form of Vitamin C that reacts very slowly with oxygen and can be used topically. It helps stimulate the growth of collagen and elastin, which are vital to the skin\u2019s youthful appearance. C the Change\u00ae Ester C\u00ae serum not only contains Ester C\u00ae and other ingredients rich in Vitamin C, but it also has rich sources of Vitamin E. Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant whose effectiveness is enhanced when used along with Vitamin C. It is important to use a topical antioxidant serum along with taking antioxidant supplements to maximize their effectiveness. Antioxidants taken internally do not reach the top layers of the skin, so using a topical antioxidant treatment will ensure that you get the full benefits. Recommended for all skin types. Also recommended for mature skin.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

Seaweed extract provides trace minerals while antioxidants Ester C\u00ae and Vitamin E protect skin from free radical damage. Using Balancing Toner after cleansing will remove excess cleanser and prepare the skin for moisturizing. Toner is the unsung hero of your face care regimen. Even after a thorough rinsing, trace amounts of cleanser remain on your face and can clog your pores and make your skins texture look rough and uneven. Using a toner on a cotton pad helps to remove the excess traces of cleanser, dirt and makeup that may be left on your skin after you cleanse. Doing this prepares your skin for any topical serums and moisturizers you choose to apply, since only the cleanest, freshest and newest skin is on the surface. There is no barrier preventing full absorption of topical vitamin serums, such as C the Change\u00ae Ester C\u00ae Serum. Balancing Toner is also your first line of defense against free radical damage. It is rich in antioxidant ingredients such as organic white tea, Ester C\u00ae andpanthenol (natural Vitamin B), which all work to repair or prevent free radical damage to the skin. Using them in conjunction increases their effectiveness, helping you achieve a more youthful appearance. Made with 78% Certified Organic ingredients. Recommended for all skin types.",

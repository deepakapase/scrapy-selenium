Our Baby Dove Rich Moisture Bar is formulated to offer more than just mild cleansing: It helps replenish the moisture and essential nutrients lost during bathing, all with a specially developed fragrance for baby's delicate skin. Gentler and more nourishing than ordinary baby soap bars*, our baby bar has a hypoallergenic and pH-neutral formula that\u2019s ophthalmologist, dermatologist and pediatrician tested. With a pH-neutral formula and enriched with our \u00bc moisturizing cream, our Baby Dove Bar keeps your baby\u2019s skin feeling extra soft and helps prevent the dryness that other ordinary baby soap bars can cause. And with a delicate fragrance, you can simply just enjoy those special bathtime moments, knowing you\u2019re giving your little one\u2019s skin the care it deserves.

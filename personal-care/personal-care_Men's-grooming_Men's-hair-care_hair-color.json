The innovative formula reduces gray without getting rid of it completely. The applicator brush is specifically designed for facial hair and lets you control the application.

It's gentle and long lasting -- there's no ammonia or peroxide. And yet the natural look lasts until you gray grows back. We believe in freedom of grooming. Men should feel free to look however they wish to look-with or without gray hair. When men want to enhance, reduce or get rid of their gray, they come to Combe. Our Just For Men brand is #1 in the world, because men trust us to create products that deliver superior, natural-looking results. No other brand is 100% dedicated to giving men easy options to groom away their gray so they can look the way they want to look every day. Made in the USA.",

This is when the convenience of cleansing facial wipes cannot be denied. Pond's Original Fresh Wet Cleansing Towelettes are gentle, textured cleansing cloths.

The dermatologist tested pads remove excess oil and other impurities to leave your skin clean, fresh, and less susceptible to blemishes.Clean the skin thoroughly before applying this product. Cover the entire affected area with a thin layer one to three times daily. Because excessive drying of the skin may occur, start with one application daily, then gradually increase to two or three times daily if needed or as directed by a doctor. If bothersome dryness or peeling occurs, reduce application to once a day or every other day. Avoid contact with eyes. If contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.",

Then the dermatologist-tested cleanser uses the power of beta hydroxy acid to remove dead surface skin that can dry and dull your complexion thus improving the feel and look of your skin. This facial cleanser is alcohol-free and oil-free, so it won't dry your skin or leave behind pore-clogging residue. Non-comedogenic, it helps eliminate rough, dull skin without leaving behind pore-clogging residue, so skin feels clean and refreshed.",

Integrating lip care into sun care with beneficial including coconut oil and shea butter. Created by and for surfers (and all their friends who love to play and be in the sun and salt water). Scented with natural coconut for a true beach vibe- no matter where your adventures may happen. What else you should know: Remember, your sunscreen only works if you use it correctly! Shake this can well as it contains suspended minerals that you need for best results. Apply liberally to all exposed skin. SPF numbers are determined in a lab. In the real world, no matter what the SPF, sunscreens start to lose effectiveness over time (2 hours max). So it's important to reapply every two hours or less and after swimming or heavy sweating. The most important factor is that you need to use enough sunscreen for adequate protection. And while our sunscreens apply evenly and can have a more translucent look, they work as a block and you need to cover your skin completely for effective results. What else you should know: Every true beauty knows it's what's on the inside that matters.Formulated without petroleum, parabens, silicones, retinyl palmitate, phthalates & chemical UV absorbers.Directions. Sun damage is serious and sunscreens are only effective if you use them properly!",

More than just a regular men\u2019s bar soap, this bar from the #1 Dermatologist Recommended Men\u2019s Brand has a formula that cleanses your skin and delivers refreshment and skin comfort. This body bar is part of the Dove Clean Comfort range and unlike regular bar soap for men which can dry your skin out, the Dove Men+Care bar contains \u00bc moisturizing cream that helps maintain skin\u2019s hydration and moisture levels, while also delivering a refreshing clean. Dove Men+Care understands the importance of having a simple daily routine for caring for your skin. This Dove Clean Comfort Body and Face Bar is noncomedogenic and can be used across your whole body to gently clean skin and is even mild enough for use on your face. In the shower, simply wet the Dove Men+Care bar and rub it between your hands to produce a light foam lather before working it over your skin and rinsing thoroughly. The creamy foam rinses away easily and the non-greasy foaming lather will provide a comfortable, refreshing clean.<br>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dove Men+Care Clean Comfort Body and Face Bar thoroughly cleanses and hydrates for healthier, stronger skin versus regular soap<br>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 #1 Dermatologist Recommended<br>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Made with 1/4 moisturizing cream - thoroughly cleans skin without leaving it feel dry or tight<br>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Patented design with unique technology developed for men's skin<br>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clean Comfort refreshing scent for a cool kick of freshness<br>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mild formula rinses cleanly and fights skin dryness",

Skin looks healthier with refined texture and pores appear tighter and minimized. Imperfections appear less visible.<br><br>Daily, squeeze product into hands and add water to transform clay-to-mousse. Gently massage onto face using circular motions, avoiding the eye area. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. In case of contact with eyes, rinse them immediately and thoroughly. In case of irritation or discomfort, decrease the frequency of application.",

Integrating lip care into sun care with beneficial including coconut oil and shea butter. Created by and for surfers (and all their friends who love to play and be in the sun and salt water). Scented with natural coconut for a true beach vibe- no matter where your adventures may happen. What else you should know: Remember, your sunscreen only works if you use it correctly! Shake this can well as it contains suspended minerals that you need for best results. Apply liberally to all exposed skin. SPF numbers are determined in a lab. In the real world, no matter what the SPF, sunscreens start to lose effectiveness over time (2 hours max). So it's important to reapply every two hours or less and after swimming or heavy sweating. The most important factor is that you need to use enough sunscreen for adequate protection. And while our sunscreens apply evenly and can have a more translucent look, they work as a block and you need to cover your skin completely for effective results. What else you should know: Every true beauty knows it's what's on the inside that matters.Formulated without petroleum, parabens, silicones, retinyl palmitate, phthalates & chemical UV absorbers.Directions. Sun damage is serious and sunscreens are only effective if you use them properly!",

This provides multiple benefits - comforts irritated skin, deeply moisturizes dry, cracked skin, hydrates chapped lips, soothes dry, irritated scalp, conditions hair, protects hair from heat, and softens skin and hair.                                                 Directions: Use sparingly. A little goes a long way. Natural Shea Butter solidifies below normal room temperature, but will melt in the warmth of your hands.",

Shake this can well as it contains suspended minerals that you need for best results. Apply liberally to all exposed skin and rub in with your hands for an even coverage. SPF numbers are determined in a lab. In the real world, no matter what the SPF, sunscreens start to lose effectiveness over time (2 hours max). So it's important to reapply every two hours or less and after swimming or heavy sweating. The most important factor is that you need to use enough sunscreen for adequate protection. An opaque bronze tint should be expected with this product for best results.What else you should know: Every true beauty knows it's what's on the inside that matters.Formulated without petroleum, parabens, silicones, retinyl palmitate, phthalates & chemical UV absorbers.Directions.

        "description": "When a big, irritating pimple has to go, stick on one of these dots and let it work its magic. Each remarkable patch draws fluids and oils out and away from the skin to reduce inflammation while the tight seal keeps skin moist to encourage faster healing and reduce risk of scarring. Non-drying treatment is focused directly on the problem while an occlusive barrier keeps bacteria out and prevents touching, picking and popping. Invisible patches disappear on skin and stay in place even while you sleep. <br><br>The Alba Botanica\u00ae\u00a0brand was born in 1979 and follows a simple mission - to Do Beautiful. To honor that vision, we created a vibrant line of body-loving products that\u00a0nourish the skin, hair, and of course, the soul. Whether we\u2019re creating a fan favorite formula or working on\u00a0the next big thing, we\u2019re dedicated to making high quality, 100% vegetarian products that\u00a0overflow with botanical ingredients. We aim to help fellow women look beautiful on the outside while feeling\u00a0beautiful on the inside.",

Cremo's formula features powerful moisturizers and beard-specific conditioners that penetrate coarse facial hair to soften from the inside, giving you -and those close to you- an astonishingly superior feel.

It optically matches the natural light diffusing properties of skin\u2014so by gently tapping it into wrinkles and lines they will appear to vanish. - Mike Bell, Boots Skincare Scientific Advisor",

        "description": "Revitalift Bright Reveal Peel Pads are a derm inspired anti-wrinkle plus brightening treatment.  This daily peel pad resurfaces dull, uneven tone and rough texture to reveal underlying youthful skin.  It is the first step to help skin absorb our powerfully concentrated treatments:  Formulated with Glycolic Acid, a gold standard in brightening, recognized by dermatologists, our formula is clinically tested to gently yet effectively help dissolve uneven skin tone and reduce visibility of uneven skin tone and wrinkles. Multi-ply textured pads physically resurface dead skin cells to reveal underlying, youthful looking skin, instantly unveiling a bright, luminous, lit-from-within glow.  Instantly peel away dull, rough and uneven tone to reveal newly-lit, newly-smooth skin.<br><br>Not Applicable<br><br>Use only as directed. Every night, smooth gently over cleansed skin. Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact with eyes, rinse immediately. Newly revealed skin may be sensitive to sunlight. Be sure to use Bright Reveal Brightening Moisturizer SPF 30.<br><br>Caution:  Flammable until dry.  Do not use near fire, flame or heat.  <br><br>Sunburn alert:  This product contains an alpha hydroxy acid (aha) that may increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn.  Use a sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterwards.",

Lightweight and silky in texture, Simple Water Boost Hydrating Booster delivers instant moisture to thirsty skin, reversing dehydration symptoms such as dry, tight feeling or tired-looking skin and leaving it looking and feeling healthy and soft to the touch.  <br><br>During the day your body continually works to maintain hydration levels, to keep your skin in its best condition.  Factors such as air pollution, harsh weather, temperature changes, air conditioning, stress, and lack of sleep can cause your natural hydration cycle to get out of balance and as a result, skin can become dry and dehydrated. <br>Specially developed with skin-essential ingredients, minerals and a plant extract, Simple Water Boost Hydrating Booster absorbs down into skin (the stratum corneum) to enable long-lasting hydration .<br><br>Our booster gives you on-demand hydration: you decide the level of hydration that\u2019s right for your skin, by choosing how to apply it and how much to use. Use pre-moisturizer as an all-over hydrating primer; mix with your facial moisturizer for long lasting hydration, or apply directly to specific dehydrated or dry areas on your face.<br><br>Its lightweight, hydrating formula instantly quenches thirsty skin, smoothing away tightness and dryness for providing long-lasting hydration. Skin feels more comfortable, supple and looks naturally dewy-fresh with every use.<br><br>The Simple Water Boost Hydrating Booster is part of the new Simple Water Boost skincare range dedicated to reversing the 5 early symptoms of dehydration: dryness, roughness, feelings of tightness, dullness and dry dehydration lines; to leave skin revitalized, supple and dewy fresh.   Why not try our other products as part of your hydration skincare routine?  We recommend cleansing your face with the Simple Water Boost Micellar Facial Gel Wash or Simple Water Boost Micellar Cleansing Water, before applying the Simple Water Boost Hydrating Booster, and finishing with your favorite Simple daily face moisturizer.",

Firming Mask, inspired by the layering ideology in Korean beauty, contains two sheet masks soaked in two unique essence formulas that, when layered, combine to reveal radiant, glowing-from-within skin in one step. The Firming Mask is applied first to deliver potent circulation-boosting ingredients such as Strawberry, Ginger, Royal Jelly, Honey, Blueberry and Licorice. The Moisture Mask, made of face-shaping Tension fibers, is layered on top to aid in the lifting and tightening of the skin while the moisturizing essence sinks through the Firming Mask to provide deep hydration.<br>How to Use: <br>In morning or evening, follow the below steps for a complete masking experience.<br>Step 1: Apply Firming Mask to clean, dry skin after cleansing and toning. <br>Step 2: Apply Moisture mask over Step 1, hooking the holes to the right and left of the cheeks around the ears. Use the bottom ear loops to gently pull the chin taut and upward, hooking the second set of ear loops around each ear. Wear for 30 minutes, then remove. Pat excess essence gently into the skin until absorbed. Follow up with serum if desired and finish with moisturizer to lock in hydration.",

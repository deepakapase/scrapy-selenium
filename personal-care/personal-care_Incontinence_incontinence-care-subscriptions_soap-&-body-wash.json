Named after the mythical bird that combusts only to be reborn from its ashes, AXE Phoenix Body Wash's earthy composition and subtle blend of wood and fruit let you be reborn every morning and night. To use, squeeze out the body wash into your palm and work into a foamy lather through your body. Rinse thoroughly and finish with your favorite AXE fragrance. To improve your shower experience, try the AXE Shower Detailer. Simply pour your AXE Phoenix Body Wash onto the AXE Detailer - a dual-sided shower tool that helps to both exfoliate and gently clean. The scrub side of the AXE Detailer removes dead skin and debris from rough spots like elbows and heels. Soft mesh on the flipside lathers to clean sensitive areas. Simply hang it to dry in the shower after getting clean. AXE Phoenix Body Wash is also available in Antiperspirant Stick, Daily Fragrance (previously known as body spray), Deodorant Stick, and Shampoo plus Conditioner for all of your grooming needs. AXE Phoenix Body Wash is also available in a 28 fl oz bottle with a convenient pump that dispenses the perfect amount of body wash every time. Find Your Magic with AXE - The No. 1 Male Body Wash Brand in the World. *Source: Euromonitor International Limited; Men's bath and shower retail value sales, 2015.

This action helps clear problematic impurities which immediately brightens and refreshes skin. The clay's unique physical texture also polishes away dead surface cells, leaving skin with a smooth, even glow. Tropical infusions of nourishing Torch Ginger, soothing Lotus Flower and antioxidant-rich Yerba Mata replenish and support skin's natural defenses.

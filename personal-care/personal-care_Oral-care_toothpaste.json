And some whitening toothpastes could make the problem worse, as abrasive toothpastes can wear on the soft exposed dentin. Luckily, Sensodyne , the #1 dentist recommended brand for sensitive teeth, has a solution. New Sensodyne True White toothpaste is specially developed to relieve sensitivity pain and help whiten sensitive teeth. It is 10x less abrasive than many leading whitening toothpastes*, so it's less harsh on sensitive, softer areas of the teeth. Based on Relative Dentin Abrasivity testing against 34 products in the top 80% of the whitening toothpaste market. **With twice daily brushing.",

If this is the first time you have had vaginal itch and discomfort, consult your doctor. If you have had a doctor diagnose a vaginal yeast infection before and have the same symptoms now, use this ointment as directed. This product is for the treatment of recurrent vaginal yeast infections only. It does not treat other infections and does not prevent pregnancy. This product, a vaginal ointment that contains an antifungal medicine, works by killing the overgrowth of yeast. When can you expect symptom relief? While this product is a 1-dose treatment, most women do not experience complete relief of their symptoms in just one day. Most women experience some improvement within one day and complete relief of symptoms within 7 days. If your symptoms do not improve in 3 days or if you still have symptoms after 7 days, consult your doctor. Your doctor may recommend other treatment, or you may have a condition other than a yeast infection. If your symptoms return within 2 months or if you think you have been exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, consult your doctor immediately. Recurring yeast infections may be a sign of pregnancy or a serious condition, such as AIDS or diabetes.",

Goes on smoothly so it doesn't tug too hard and pull on your delicate areas. Scented with natural coconut for a true beach vibe- no matter where your adventures may happen. Created by and for surfers (and all their friends who love to play and be in the sun and salt water).What else you should know: Remember, your sunscreen only works if you use it correctly! SPF numbers are determined in a lab. In the real world, no matter what the SPF, sunscreens start to lose effectiveness over time (2 hours max). So it's important to reapply every two hours or less and after swimming or heavy sweating. The most important factor is that you need to use enough sunscreen for adequate protection. And while our sunscreens apply evenly and can have a more translucent look, they work as a block and you need to cover your skin completely for effective results. What else you should know: Every true beauty knows it's what's on the inside that matters.Formulated without petroleum, parabens, silicones, retinyl palmitate, phthalates & chemical UV absorbers.Directions. Sun damage is serious and sunscreens are only effective if you use them properly! Sun protection measures. Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer & early skin aging. To decrease this risk, regularly use a sunscreen with a broad spectrum SPF value of 15 or higher & other sun protection measures including: Limit time in the sun, especially from 10 am - 2 pm. Wear long-sleeve shirts, pants, hats, and sunglasses when in the sun.WarningsFor external use only. Do not use:On damaged or broken skin. Stop use and ask a doctor if rash occurs. When using this product, keep out of eyes. Rinse with water to remove. Keep out of reach of children. If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away. Can stain clothing. Keep away from clothes.Sun protection measures. Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer & early skin aging.

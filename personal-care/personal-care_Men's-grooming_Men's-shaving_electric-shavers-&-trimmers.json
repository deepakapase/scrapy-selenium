DualPrecision razor heads are designed to quickly and comfortably shave both long and short hair. With the Flex and Float System, heads follow the contours of your face, allowing for better contact with your skin and for catching more hairs - resulting in a closer, faster shave. The Skin Protection System has rounded low-friction heads that adjust to the contours of your face to limit skin irritation. The integrated pop-up trimmer conveniently trims sideburns and moustaches.  Shaver 4200 comes with a 45 day risk-free trial and a full 2-year warranty. For best results, replace shaving heads with HQ8 replacement heads every 12 months.",

It includes five precision-honed, ultra-sharp, hypoallergenic Nanotech blades, powered by a high-efficiency 14,000 cpm linear-drive motor. An Arc 5 Multi-Flex, quick-pivoting shaving head traces facial contours and an active shaving sensor detects different beard densities as you shave to adjust cutting power where needed for smoother results.The Ultimate in Closeness and Comfort The premium Arc5 mens electric razor system provides the ultimate in closeness and comfort with five ultra-sharp, ultra-thin Nanotech blades. Arc 5 inner blades are forged and honed to an acute 30\u00b0 cutting edge to cut more cleanly and efficiently at the root for the ultimate in cleaner, more efficient and comfortable shaving. Active Shaving SensorAdvanced, built-in Arc5 sensors automatically detect varying differences in beard density along the cheeks, neck and jaw. As the electric razor moves across your face, power flow is continually adjusted to accelerate where beard is thickest, and soften where it's not.Premium Grooming PerformanceThe premium Arc5 system makes it easy to comfortably shave the hard-to-reach areas of your face. The agile Multi-Flex pivoting head and Multi-Fit outer foil effortlessly glide, flex and pivot along the contours of the face, jaw, chin and neck to shave from any direction. A built-in precision trimmer with a fine, 45\u00b0 angled blade gives mustaches and sideburns the perfect finish and detail. Flexible Micro-Thin FoilsThree micro-thin Arc 5 foils cleanly capture, hold and cut the different types of hair that make up the beard. And, the slight arc of the foils allow them to keep in close contact with the skin, for quick, clean shaving. 14,000 CPM Hyper Performance Linear MotorA smooth, clean shave is also fast with a quiet, high-performance Arc5 linear motor designed to shave at speeds of 14,000 cycles per minute (cpm), and ensure peak performance from beginning to end of every battery charge. Compared with 10,000 cpm shavers, the Arc5 operates nearly 1.5 times faster, with twice the cutting force. Wet/Dry ConvenienceWhether you're in a hurry or have time to spare, the premium wet dry Arc5 is ready when you are. Use the Arc 5 for a quick, dry shave when short on time or when time permits. Shave over the sink or in the shower with your favorite shaving foam or gel. 100% WashableThis powerful shaver is also a breeze to clean. Simply hold it under hold warm, running water to quickly rinse away hair stubble and gel or foam residue.Ideal for TravelThe ES-LV65-S shaver is designed with universal voltage for comfortable shaving while travelling. It also includes an AC adaptor, travel safety lock and travel pouch.",

And as battery power is used, this high-performance motor maintains continuous peak performance to the end of every battery charge.Ultra-Thin ARC Foil SystemThree contoured, micro-thin hypoallergenic foils instantly capture, hold and cut the different types of hair that make up the beard for outstanding closeness and comfort. The distinctly patterned Lift-Tech Foil applies reverse-tapered edges to gently raise and cut hairs that lie flat. The Slit Blade Foil grabs and cuts longer hairs that often grow in opposite directions. And, the Finishing Foil captures stubborn, extra-thick hair to ensure smooth, even results. Shave Sensor TechnologyAdvanced built-in sensors automatically \"feel\"differences in beard density along the cheeks, jaw and neck. As the ARC3 shaver moves across the face, power flow is continually adjusted to accelerate where the beard is thickest, and soften where it's not.3D Multi-Flex\u0099 Pivoting HeadAs you shave, an advanced 3D Multi-Flex Pivoting Head glides seamlessly - up and down, side-to-side and back-and-forth - to trace the individual contours of your face, neck and jaw for the ultimate in close, gentle comfort. Precision Pop-Up TrimmerAfter shaving, add the perfect finish with an ultra-sharp 45\u00b0 blade pop-up trimmer. Ideal for precision detailing of sideburns and mustaches.Shave Close and Conveniently Dry or in the ShowerWhen you're in a hurry, the wet/dry ARC3 delivers a quick, smooth dry shave. And, because it's 100% washable and fully immersible in water, it also performs as efficiently in the shower as it does over the sink using your favorite foam or gel.Natural, Sure-Grip Design for Total ControlDesigned to fit comfortably in either hand, the ergonomic, soft-touch rubber grip ensures total shaving control, even when used in the shower.Check Shaver Status at a GlanceThe easy-to-read, multi-function LED in the handle makes it quick and simple to check shaver functions like battery power level, recharging status, travel lock on/off and more. Men's Shaver Replacement Blades and FoilsTo help maintain the level of grooming comfort and satisfaction you demand from your shaver, the high-performance blades and foils should be replaced with genuine, easy-to-install Panasonic replacements blades and foils.",

And all are hypoallergenic for safe, irritation-free shaving on sensitive skin.<br><br>30\u00b0 Nano Polished Blades <br>The ultra-sharp, 30\u00b0 cutting edge of ARC 3 blades provides an incredibly close shave. Driven by a high-power motor drive, the blades cut cleanly and comfortably through even the toughest beards.<br><br>Ultra-Thin ARC Foil System <br>As you shave, three hypoallergenic ARC foils work simultaneously to provide close, clean and even results.

It includes five precision-honed, ultra-sharp, hypoallergenic Nanotech blades, powered by a high-efficiency 14,000 cpm linear-drive motor. An Arc 5 Multi-Flex, quick-pivoting shaving head traces facial contours and an active shaving sensor detects different beard densities as you shave to adjust cutting power where needed for smoother results.The Ultimate in Closeness and Comfort The premium Arc5 mens electric razor system provides the ultimate in closeness and comfort with five ultra-sharp, ultra-thin Nanotech blades. Arc 5 inner blades are forged and honed to an acute 30\u00b0 cutting edge to cut more cleanly and efficiently at the root for the ultimate in cleaner, more efficient and comfortable shaving. Active Shaving SensorAdvanced, built-in Arc5 sensors automatically detect varying differences in beard density along the cheeks, neck and jaw. As the electric razor moves across your face, power flow is continually adjusted to accelerate where beard is thickest, and soften where it's not.Premium Grooming PerformanceThe premium Arc5 system makes it easy to comfortably shave the hard-to-reach areas of your face. The agile Multi-Flex pivoting head and Multi-Fit outer foil effortlessly glide, flex and pivot along the contours of the face, jaw, chin and neck to shave from any direction. A built-in precision trimmer with a fine, 45\u00b0 angled blade gives mustaches and sideburns the perfect finish and detail. Flexible Micro-Thin FoilsThree micro-thin Arc 5 foils cleanly capture, hold and cut the different types of hair that make up the beard. And, the slight arc of the foils allow them to keep in close contact with the skin for quick, clean shaving. Use the Arc 5 for a quick, dry shave when short on time or when time permits. Shave over the sink or in the shower with your favorite shaving foam or gel. Clean and Charge StationThe Arc5 is also 100% washable and, with the included automatic cleaning and charging station, rinses the shaver clean under running water with sonic vibration cleaning mode. Once cleaned, the station dries and charges the Arc5 shaver to keep it in pristine condition and ready for the next shave.Ideal for TravelThe ES-LV95-S is designed with universal voltage for comfortable shaving while travelling. It also includes an AC adaptor, travel safety lock and travel pouch.",

Simply click the shaving head off and click on the beard styler. The styler's rounded tips glide gently across your skin, preventing irritation. The styler's beard and mustache comb offers a choice of five length settings--from 0.5 millimeters to 5 millimeters--so you can choose the length that's right for you. Or, use the styler without the comb for a stubble look. You'll get precise trimming and detailing for the perfect finish.",

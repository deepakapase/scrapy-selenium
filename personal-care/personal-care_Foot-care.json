The Amope GelActiv line is designed to give women the highest comfort and freedom in the shoes they love and enables them to wear them confidently. Like a best friend, women can rely on Amope GelActiv due to extensive research and investigation into the anatomy of the human foot, to understand what happens to the musculo-skeletal structure when wearing high heels and what technology could deliver an optimum solution. Based on this broad knowledge the core range is made of the high quality visco-elastic polymer gel providing effective prevention and also helps relieve pain, discomfort from pressure and friction (rubbing) caused by ladies\u2019 shoes. Pack contents: Comes with 1 pair of reusable cushions.<br><br>DIRECTIONS: Peel protective film off cushion. Insert cushion into back of shoe sticky side down where the heel would fall.

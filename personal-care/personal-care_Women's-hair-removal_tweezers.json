        "description": "Packaging may vary. Grabs every hair, every time. Famous for its precision, the Tweezerman Slant Tweezer features perfectly aligned hand-filed tips for expert brow shaping. <br><br>How to use: To ease tweezing, take a hot shower or use a warm washcloth to open pores. Tweeze in the direction of hair growth to avoid breakage. To close pores post tweezing, use cold water or astringent. For expert results, never yank or tug on brow hairs - always use the Slant's precision tip to isolate, lift and then grab the hair from the root. Effortlessly pull using one smooth motion in the direction of hair growth. This not only helps avoid breaking the hair, it's gentler on your skin. When you smoothly glide each entire hair out, broken stubble and \"black dots\" won't be left behind, instead you create a flawless, expertly shaped, clean look. Advanced handling lets you use the very point of the Slant for finer or trickier hairs. <br><br>How to clean: Clean tweezer tips after each use with isopropyl alcohol or peroxide. Do not sanitize body of tweezer as the color enamel finish will wear off.",

Tweeze in the direction of hair growth to avoid breakage. To close pores post tweezing, use cold water or astringent. For expert results, never yank or tug on brow hairs - always use the Slant's precision tip to isolate, lift and then grab the hair from the root. Effortlessly pull using one smooth motion in the direction of hair growth. This not only helps avoid breaking the hair, it's gentler on your skin. When you smoothly glide each entire hair out, broken stubble and 'black dots' won't be left behind, and instead you create a flawless, expertly shaped, clean look. Advanced handling lets you use the very point of the Slant for finer or trickier hairs. <br><br>How to clean: Disinfect tweezer tips with isopropyl alcohol or peroxide after each use. You cannot autoclave or place this item in barbicide. This tweezer can be sharpened, however, the protective coating will no longer be on the tips of the implement.",

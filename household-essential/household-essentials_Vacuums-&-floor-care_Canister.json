It\u2019s the only vacuum cleaner with strong constant suction and no dirty bags or filters to wash or replace.<br><br>The Dyson Cinetic Big Ball canister vacuum features monostatic, self-righting technology. The vacuum lies on a single stable resting point assembled in a spherical array. With the heaviest components near the floor, and a curved body with a low center of gravity, whenever the vacuum is displaced from its resting position, gravitational force will automatically return it upright. Or more simply, when it\u2019s knocked over, it gets back up.<br><br>The Dyson Cinetic Big Ball canister vacuum features a new bin emptying mechanism. You can hygienically drive out trapped dust and debris with just the push of a button. There\u2019s no need to touch the dirt. While cleaning, an articulated handle rotates in three directions allowing 360\u00b0 articulation for easy, versatile and greater control \u2013 all around the home, from floors to furniture to even high corners.<br><br>Includes a 5 year warranty covering parts and labor.",

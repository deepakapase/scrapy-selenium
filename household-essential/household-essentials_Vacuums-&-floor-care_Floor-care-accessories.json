It is best to check the dirt level in the bag before each use. For best performance, it is recommended that you change your bag when it is 1/2 to 2/3 full or when the outside of the bag feels firm to the touch. When accumulated, small dust particles can keep the air from circulating; this can reduce the suction in your vacuum. You may need to change your bag more frequently when vacuuming fine dust and debris, pet hair or new carpet. It is also recommended to check your vacuum\u2019s filters at the same time you check the bag.",

        "description": "The Tangle-Free Turbine Tool has counter-rotating heads with brushes to remove hair and dirt from carpets and upholstery. Because there\u2019s no brush for hair to wrap around, more hair is released straight into the bin. A clean air turbine provides the flexible heads with constant power over uneven surfaces. It\u2019s the only turbine tool that doesn\u2019t get tangled.<br><br>When hair wraps around the brush bar of conventional turbine tools, they slow down or stop working. Tangled hair then has to be removed by hand. The Tangle-free Turbine tool works differently. Elliptical counter-rotating heads with integrated brushes are engineered to maximize hair pick-up and release dirt and hair straight into the bin. The heads are positioned so the brushes reach to the front and sides of the tool, drawing in hair and dirt from all directions. This provides edge-to-edge coverage of the cleaning surface, right up against the edges of stairs and upholstery. The flexible heads and articulating base plate ensure that the brushes remain in constant contact with a surface \u2013 no matter how uneven.<br><br>A clean air turbine is positioned on top of the tool to guarantee continuous airflow to drive the heads. Angled air bleeds direct airflow to the center of the heads for improved dirt removal, and an air inlet ensures that air flowing through the tool strips hair from the bristles and directs it into the bin. A mesh filter prevents dust entering the turbine and degrading performance.<br><br>The Tangle-free Turbine tool is compatible with all Dyson upright and canister vacuums on Target.com and comes with a 1 year warranty.<br><br>ALSO AVAILABLE IN THE DYSON CAR CLEANING KIT.",

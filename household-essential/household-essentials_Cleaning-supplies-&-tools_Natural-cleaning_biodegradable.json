Our toilet bowl cleaner cleans and deodorizes the entire bowl without using chlorine, dyes or solvents. Essential oils and plant-derived ingredients make it effective, biodegradable and septic safe. Made in the USA.<br><br>DIRECTIONS FOR USE: Begin by flushing the toilet in order to wet the sides of the bowl. Give the bottle a good squeeze to squirt a ring of cleaner under the rim. Wait 5-10 minutes, then brush and flush. Cleans and deodorizes your entire bowl without using chlorine or solvents.<br><br>USES: Q. Is the Toilet Bowl Cleaner effective when used with hard water? A. Yes, You can use the Toilet Bowl Cleaner if you have hard water. The acidic cleaning agents in our toilet bowl cleaner are not as strong as mass-market toilet bowl cleaners that are hydrochloric acid-based. This means that you may have to use our product more often to prevent the hard water mineral deposits that develop at the water line from building up. Q. Is your Toilet Bowl Cleaner septic safe? A. Yes, all of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Prod",

With a thicker formula and easy to pour bottle, there is more control, less drips, and less waste. Splash-Less Bleach can whiten dingy fabrics, remove tough stains, and clean and deodorize other household surfaces. Clorox bleach is great to use for everyday cleaning and seasonal cleaning needs, including Spring Cleaning and Back to School. The concentrated bleach comes in a smaller easy to use bottle with an easy to grip handle to prevent messy spills. This sodium hypochlorite bleach can be used in both standard and high efficiency washing machines. Clorox Splash-Less Bleach's thicker formula offers the same cleaning power of liquid bleach but without the worry of messy drips and splashes.<br><br>Usage Directions: For laundry, first sort laundry by color.

The dual tip applicator has a fine point so that you can concentrate the bleach right where you need it and the broad scrubber allows you to rub out the stain. Carry it in your purse for bleaching whites with messy stains anywhere on the go. Great for cleaning mold and mildew from your kitchen and bathroom tile and grout and those hard to reach areas throughout your home. Usage Directions: For laundry, use only on white, bleach-safe fabrics. Shake before use and unscrew cap on chosen tip. Do not remove both caps at the same time. Squeeze and apply liberally to stain. (Note: Using large quantities increases the chance of affecting adjacent colors.) Replace cap. Rub stain. Leave for one minute and dab off Bleach Pen Gel with a paper towel. For best results, wash your clothes immediately after applying the gel. Remove garment before treating. To remove stains around the house on tile, grout, caulking and porcelain, shake before use and unscrew cap on chosen tip. Do not remove both caps at the same time. Squeeze, apply liberally and replace cap. Rub stain and rinse or wipe clean immediately.Ingredients: Anionic and nonionic surfactants, sodium hypochlorite bleach. Contains no phosphorus. Conforms to ASTM D4236.Warnings: CAUTION: EYE IRRITANT. Avoid contact with eyes. May cause skin irritation. For sensitive skin or prolonged use, wear rubber gloves.",

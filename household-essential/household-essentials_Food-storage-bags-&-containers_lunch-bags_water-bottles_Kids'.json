This kids water bottle features double-wall insulation, which reduces condensation (and accidental drops). The lid is leak-proof (when closed), and a button lock prevents kids from accidentally opening the lid as they race around the yard. Made from Eastman Tritan plastic, the Flo Duo Kids Water Bottle can withstand plenty of impact, even from kids who love roughhousing (it also resists stains and odors too, so your kids taste their drink, not their bottle!). The chug-style lid is easy to drink from, and a comfortable carry handle is attached so kids can stay hydrated no matter where they run off to. With the bubba 12oz Flo Duo Kids Water Bottle, your kid is ready to drink on the go!",

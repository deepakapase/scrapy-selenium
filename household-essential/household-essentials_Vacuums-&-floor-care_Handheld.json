The fast charger re-charges your hand vacuum in only 4 hours. The translucent dust bowl allows you to see when the 16.9 oz bowl needs to be emptied. The washable bowl and filters provide for thorough cleaning. The vacuum has a convenient built-in extendable crevice tool for hard to reach areas and flip-up brush for dusting. This vacuum is white with grey and black accents. Backed by a 2 Year Limited Warranty.",

The large 16.9 ounce translucent bagless dirt canister allows you to see when the vacuum needs to be emptied and is easy to use. The filter is removable and washable for long life. The pet attachment effectively removes pet hair better than a motorized brush and without tangles. Kit includes: hand vacuum, Pet Hair Tool, Flip-up Brush, Crevice Tool, Washable Filter (PVF110), and charger. Backed by a 2 Year Limited Warranty.",

This hand vacuum weighs only 2.6 pounds.  The cyclonic action rapidly spins debris away from the filter to keep the filter clean and the suction power strong.  The HHVI320JR02 provides great suction with 18 Air Watts making it a breeze to pick up the most common household debris.  A rotating slim nozzle gives you access to tight spots better than traditionally shaped hand vacuums and gives you a comforable hand position when accessing hard to reach areas.  The large 20.6 oz translucent bagless dirt bowl makes it easy to see when it is full and is very easy to empty and wash for thorough cleaning.  The vacuum has a convenient built-in extendable crevice tool for hard to reach areas and flip-up brush for dusting.  The jack plug charger is a versatile solution for charging throughout your home and the included wall mount provides for convenient storage.  Kit includes: (1) Lithium Hand Vacuum with on-board extendable crevice tool and flip-up brush; (1) Jack Plug Charger, (1) Wall Mount, and (1) Washable Bag Filter (VF110).

The patented 'motor in the filter' technology allows the hand Vac to be ultra compact.  It offers a long crevice tool for tight areas such as underneath and in between car seats.  The combined crevice and soft brush is all in one tool for ease of use.  This vac has dual functionality - it can be used as a traditional hand Vac or the handle can be removed for hard to reach areas.  Cyclonic action spins dirt away from the filter maintaining optimum suction power, and a filter cleaning wheel for easy and hands free cleaning of the filter.  It also features a transparent dust bowl which allows you to know when to empty the hand vac, and the side empty door is an easy to empty system which means all the dirt goes straight in the bin and your hands don't touch the dirt.  The 12V DC adapter fits into a cigarette lighter socket and the 16 foot cord allows you to reach all areas of your car including the boot cable. The cord can be easily wrapped around the car vac before storing it away. Kit Includes: (1) BDH1200PVAV Flexi Auto Vac, (1) PVF110 Filter; (1) Integrated 4 foot Flexible Hose, (1) 2-in-1 Flip-Up Brush/Wide Nozzle Tool, (1) Long Crevice Tool.

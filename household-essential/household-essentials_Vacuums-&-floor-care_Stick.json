The self-standing 2-N-1 hand/stick design provides two vacuums in one for cleaning on and above your floors.  BATTERYSENSE\u0099 technology indicates your battery state of charge so you're never caught off-guard.  FILTERSENSE\u0099 illuminates when your washable filter needs to be cleaned or replaced.

Choose low speed for sensitive applications such as vacuuming curtains + linens, or push the POWERBOOST\u0099 button for extra suction of up to 30 Air Watts for other applications.  The On/Off powered brush bar helps you deep-clean carpets and area rugs or choose the proper setting for your cleaning needs with the push of a button. The 2.0 Ah lithium ion battery holds a charge longer, provides up to 25 minutes of runtime, and is lighter than NiCad.  The self-standing design keeps the vacuum upright and ready to use.

The built-in extendable crevice tool helps you clean hard-to-reach areas, while 180\u00b0 pivot steering  provides plenty of maneuverability around furniture.  The cyclonic action helps keep the filter clean and suction strong, with a washable filter that allows you to clean it when indicated and a tool-free detachable beater bar makes cleaning quick and simple.

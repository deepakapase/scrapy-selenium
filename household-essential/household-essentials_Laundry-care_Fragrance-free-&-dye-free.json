Tide PODS are formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power in half the time (1).

So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds. This tub contains 42 laundry pacs.

It works in front and top loading washing machines, both regular and high efficiency (HE). Just toss one pac for regular loads, two pacs for large loads and three pacs for heavily soiled loads into the washing machine drum before you add clothes to get an amazing clean. Tide PODS are formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power in half the time (1). Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing suds and targets tough stains to remove them quickly. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds. This bag contains 35 laundry pacs.

(Note: Using large quantities increases the chance of affecting adjacent colors.) Replace cap. Rub stain. Leave for one minute and dab off Bleach Pen Gel with a paper towel. For best results, wash your clothes immediately after applying the gel. Remove garment before treating. To remove stains around the house on tile, grout, caulking and porcelain, shake before use and unscrew cap on chosen tip. Do not remove both caps at the same time. Squeeze, apply liberally and replace cap. Rub stain and rinse or wipe clean immediately.Ingredients: Anionic and nonionic surfactants, sodium hypochlorite bleach. Contains no phosphorus. Conforms to ASTM D4236.Warnings: CAUTION: EYE IRRITANT. Avoid contact with eyes. May cause skin irritation. For sensitive skin or prolonged use, wear rubber gloves.",

Tide PODS Free & Gentle is hypoallergenic to provide amazing clean that is gentle on your skin. Tide PODS have a built-in stain-fighter that cleans the entire load better than a liquid detergent and in-wash Oxi booster combined. It works in front and top loading washing machines, both regular and high efficiency (HE). Just toss one pac for regular loads, two pacs for large loads and three pacs for heavily soiled loads into the washing machine drum before you add clothes to get an amazing clean. Tide PODS are formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power in half the time (1). Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing suds and targets tough stains to remove them quickly. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds. This tub contains 81 laundry pacs.

Tide PODS Free & Gentle is hypoallergenic to provide amazing clean that is gentle on your skin. Tide PODS have a built-in stain-fighter that cleans the entire load better than a liquid detergent and in-wash Oxi booster combined. It works in front and top loading washing machines, both regular and high efficiency (HE). Just toss one pac for regular loads, two pacs for large loads and three pacs for heavily soiled loads into the washing machine drum before you add clothes to get an amazing clean. Tide PODS are formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power in half the time (1). Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing suds and targets tough stains to remove them quickly. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds. This tub contains 72 laundry pacs. (1) 1 dose of Tide HE Turbo Clean in quick cycle vs. 6 doses of the next leading liquid HE compatible detergent in normal cycle\u00a0",

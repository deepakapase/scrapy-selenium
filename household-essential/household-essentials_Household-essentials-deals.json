Great for storing and protecting leftovers, this multipurpose wrap seals tightly onto a variety of surfaces, such as paper, plastic, metal, wood or other dry surfaces. The Griptex technology activates when pressure is applied and seals to itself, allowing you to create custom shaped food storage bags to freeze food or to make individual portions. It also works well around the house or at work to keep things clean and protected. Press'n Seal wrap is simple to use and easy to handle. The wrap is BPA free and microwave safe. Glad protects and seals with ease.<br><br>Usage Directions: Pull the plastic food wrap from the roll. Use serrated lid for clean tearing. Place it over the desired area. Press food wrap along dry rim. Glad Press'n Seal wrap's activated gripping texture tightly seals to almost any dry surface. When using in the microwave, allow at least 1 inch of space between wrap and food. Turn back one corner of food wrap to vent.<br><br>Caution Statements: Avoid contact with cutting edge. Not for use in conventional or convection ovens, stove tops, toaster ovens or browning units. To prevent wrap from melting, foods high in fat (like bacon) or sugar (like pastries) should not come in contact with plastic wrap in the microwave. When microwaving, turn back one corner of Press'n Seal wrap to vent excess steam. Best when used on clean, dry surfaces. To avoid danger of suffocation or choking, keep this wrap away from babies and children.",

When used as directed, it has whitening power to make whites whiter and removes 70% more stains than detergent alone. Clorox Bleach removes the toughest laundry stains from white clothes including red wine, grass, dirt and blood stains. It is safe to use in traditional and high-efficiency washing machines. What's more, Clorox Bleach now contains Cloromax Technology to protect household surfaces as it cleans, so stains won't stick and cleanup is easier. Clorox Bleach also disinfects and deodorizes surfaces, killing 99.9% of germs when used as directed on countertops, floors, toilets and more. In fact, it has 33% more disinfecting power versus store brand bleach. It kills mold too. The easy grip handle prevents spillage.<br><br>Usage Directions: For laundry, sort laundry by color and add detergent. Fill bleach to max line in dispenser or add 1/2 cup bleach to wash water. Add clothes and start wash. For best results, add to wash 5 minutes after the wash cycle has begun. For cleaning and deodorizing, dilute 1/2 cup of bleach with 1 gallon of water. Pre-wash surface, mop or wipe with bleach solution. Allow solution to contact surface for at least 5 minutes. Rinse well and air dry. For prolonged use, wear rubber gloves.<br><br>Caution Statements: Eye and skin irritant. Avoid contact with eyes. For sensitive skin or prolonged use, wear rubber gloves.

The dual tip applicator has a fine point so that you can concentrate the bleach right where you need it and the broad scrubber allows you to rub out the stain. Carry it in your purse for bleaching whites with messy stains anywhere on the go. Great for cleaning mold and mildew from your kitchen and bathroom tile and grout and those hard to reach areas throughout your home. Usage Directions: For laundry, use only on white, bleach-safe fabrics. Shake before use and unscrew cap on chosen tip. Do not remove both caps at the same time. Squeeze and apply liberally to stain. (Note: Using large quantities increases the chance of affecting adjacent colors.) Replace cap. Rub stain. Leave for one minute and dab off Bleach Pen Gel with a paper towel. For best results, wash your clothes immediately after applying the gel. Remove garment before treating. To remove stains around the house on tile, grout, caulking and porcelain, shake before use and unscrew cap on chosen tip. Do not remove both caps at the same time. Squeeze, apply liberally and replace cap. Rub stain and rinse or wipe clean immediately.Ingredients: Anionic and nonionic surfactants, sodium hypochlorite bleach. Contains no phosphorus. Conforms to ASTM D4236.Warnings: CAUTION: EYE IRRITANT. Avoid contact with eyes. May cause skin irritation. For sensitive skin or prolonged use, wear rubber gloves.",

Tide PODS have a built-in stain fighter that cleans the entire load better than a liquid detergent and in-wash Oxi booster combined. It works in front and top loading washing machines, both regular and high efficiency (HE). Its Spring Meadow Scent infuses your laundry with crisp floral notes to help leave your laundry smelling great. Just toss one pac for  regular loads, two pacs for large loads and three pacs for heavily soiled loads into the washing machine drum before you add clothes to get an amazing clean. Tide PODS are formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power in half the time (1). Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing suds and targets tough stains to remove them quickly. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds. This tub contains 72 laundry pacs. <br>(1) 1 dose of Tide HE Turbo Clean in quick cycle vs. 6 doses of the next leading liquid HE compatible detergent in normal cycle\u00a0",

It works in front and top loading washing machines, both regular and high efficiency (HE). Just toss one pac for regular loads, two pacs for large loads and three pacs for heavily soiled loads into the washing machine drum before you add clothes to get an amazing clean. Tide PODS are formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power in half the time (1). Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing suds and targets tough stains to remove them quickly. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds. This tub contains 72 laundry pacs.

Providing relief from severe roach problems, killing the roaches you see as well as the ones you don't see with two types of bait.<br><br>DIRECTIONS FOR HOUSEHOLD USE It is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling. For thorough roach control, use all 12 baits at one time. To keep roaches from returning, replace all baits every three months. 1. Break Raid Double Control Small Roach Baits apart before placement. 2. For thorough roach control, all 12 baits must be used at one time. Place 10 baits in the kitchen and 2 in each bathroom. FOR LARGER KITCHENS or PARTICULARLY HEAVY INFESTATIONS, we strongly recommend using additional baits and placing at least 12-15 baits in the kitchen and 2-4 in each bathroom. If you see roaches in other areas, such as the bedroom or utility room, use 2-4 additional baits. 3. For best results, place the baits next to the wall along the baseboards, in corners, under sinks, in cabinets and near plumbing fixtures. You can even place Raid Double Control Small Baits in cabinets. Do not contaminate feed or food products or food preparation surfaces, dishes, kitchen utensils and food containers. 4. Baits work best on horizontal surfaces touching corners and walls. 5. Roaches will begin eating the bait immediately and you should expect to see fewer roaches within days. 6. Replace ALL baits every three months to keep roaches from returning. Use the 3 month reminder on the baits to indicate the date of replacement.<br><br>USES: Use indoors in corners, along walls and near entry points to kill roaches where they hide. For maximum effectiveness, place all baits at the same time. KILLS: Roaches, Palmetto Bugs, Waterbugs",

        "description": "Kills Bugs Dead. Raid Roach Gel is an easy way to apply bait, killing all common household roaches at the source. This indoor ready-to-use gel bait starts working in hours as a crack and crevice treatment in areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, basements, and garages.<br><br>DIRECTIONS FOR USE: It is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling. READ THIS LABEL: Read this entire label and follow all use directions and use precautions. Use only for the sites, pests, and application methods described on this label. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Raid Roach Gel is a ready-to-use highly attractive gel bait formulation that is very effective in controlling German and American cockroaches. BEFORE YOU START: Apply to areas not easily accessible to children and pets. Do not apply Raid Roach Gel bait to surfaces recently treated with residual insecticide sprays. Surfaces treated with Raid Roach Gel bait must not be treated with insecticidal sprays, as the bait will be rendered ineffective. Do not apply in or on electrical equipment due to the possibility of shock. Do not apply to surfaces that food contacts. Do not allow open foods to contact gel material. Do not apply in locations of high temperature or direct sunlight. Gel deposits may be cleaned up by using damp paper towel or rag while still wet, or if dried, use putty knife to scrape and discard in trash. May be used indoors as a crack and crevice treatment in and around single and multi-family residential buildings. Apply to areas roaches are commonly found, such as: Under sinks and around plumbing and pipes; to drawers and cabinet corners where roaches are known to hide; equipment legs and bases and behind and under appliances such as ovens, refrigerators, and washers; openings leading into cracks, and hollow spaces in floors, walls, and ceilings; trashcans; behind toilets; baseboards, doors and windows. Do not apply in locations of high temperature or direct sunlight. Inspect bait placements periodically and apply fresh bait as needed. HOW TO APPLY 1. Remove cap to open. 2. Place tube tip at surface to be treated. 3. Gently squeeze tube to create multiple spots of gel about the size of a pea, or apply as a line or strip. When finished, lift tube tip from surface, and replace cap to close. 4. Keep the cap on the tube to prevent gel from drying out. HOW MUCH TO APPLY For spot or gel dot applications: For heavy infestations of roaches, apply 3 to 5 spots of Raid Roach Gel bait per 10 linear feet or one square yard. For light to moderate infestations of roaches, apply 1 - 3 spots of Raid Roach Gel bait per 10 linear feet or one square yard. Each gel dot of Raid Roach Gel applied should be about the size of a pea. To apply a line of gel: For all levels of roach infestations, when a line of Raid Roach Gel bait is used, apply a small thin strip that is less than 1/8 inches wide and approximately 2 inches long. Inspect bait placements periodically and reapply fresh bait as needed.<br><br>USES: Use in hard to reach places like cracks and crevices, in corners, along walls, and near entry points to kill roaches where they hide. Kills: Cockroaches (including German and American) Where to use: In and around homes and other buildings/structures where cockroaches have infested or where they travel to seek food, water or shelter. When to use: When cockroaches are observed or there is evidence of an infestation in/around a home, building or structure.",

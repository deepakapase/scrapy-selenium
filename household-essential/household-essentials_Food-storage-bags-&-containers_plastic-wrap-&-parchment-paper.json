        "description": "Glad Press'n Seal uses Griptex technology to protect food with a leak proof and airtight seal. Great for storing and protecting leftovers, this multipurpose wrap seals tightly onto a variety of surfaces, such as paper, plastic, metal, wood or other dry surfaces. The Griptex technology activates when pressure is applied and seals to itself, allowing you to create custom shaped food storage bags to freeze food or to make individual portions. It also works well around the house or at work to keep things clean and protected. Press'n Seal wrap is simple to use and easy to handle. The wrap is BPA free and microwave safe. Glad protects and seals with ease.<br><br>Usage Directions: Pull the plastic food wrap from the roll. Use serrated lid for clean tearing. Place it over the desired area. Press food wrap along dry rim. Glad Press'n Seal wrap's activated gripping texture tightly seals to almost any dry surface. When using in the microwave, allow at least 1 inch of space between wrap and food. Turn back one corner of food wrap to vent.<br><br>Caution Statements: Avoid contact with cutting edge. Not for use in conventional or convection ovens, stove tops, toaster ovens or browning units. To prevent wrap from melting, foods high in fat (like bacon) or sugar (like pastries) should not come in contact with plastic wrap in the microwave. When microwaving, turn back one corner of Press'n Seal wrap to vent excess steam. Best when used on clean, dry surfaces. To avoid danger of suffocation or choking, keep this wrap away from babies and children.",

        "description": "Glad Press'n Seal uses Griptex technology to protect food with a leak proof and airtight seal. Great for storing and protecting leftovers, this multipurpose wrap with a charming pastel poka dot design seals tightly onto a variety of surfaces, such as paper, plastic, metal, wood or other dry surfaces. The Griptex technology activates when pressure is applied and seals to itself, allowing you to create custom shaped food storage bags to freeze food or to make individual portions. It also works well around the house or at work to keep things clean and protected. Press'n Seal wrap is simple to use and easy to handle. The wrap is BPA free and microwave safe. Glad protects and seals with ease.<br><br>Usage Directions: Pull the plastic food wrap from the roll. Use serrated lid for clean tearing. Place it over the desired area. Press food wrap along dry rim. Glad Press'n Seal wrap's activated gripping texture tightly seals to almost any dry surface. When using in the microwave, allow at least 1 inch of space between wrap and food. Turn back one corner of food wrap to vent.<br><br>Caution Statements: Avoid contact with cutting edge. Not for use in conventional or convection ovens, stove tops, toaster ovens or browning units. To prevent wrap from melting, foods high in fat (like bacon) or sugar (like pastries) should not come in contact with plastic wrap in the microwave. When microwaving, turn back one corner of Press'n Seal wrap to vent excess steam. Best when used on clean, dry surfaces. To avoid danger of suffocation or choking, keep this wrap away from babies and children.",

Great for storing and protecting leftovers, this multipurpose wrap seals tightly onto a variety of surfaces, such as paper, plastic, metal, wood or other dry surfaces. The Griptex technology activates when pressure is applied and seals to itself, allowing you to create custom shaped food storage bags to freeze food or to make individual portions. It also works well around the house or at work to keep things clean and protected. Press'n Seal wrap is simple to use and easy to handle. The wrap is BPA free and microwave safe. Glad protects and seals with ease.<br><br><br>Directions: Pull the plastic food wrap from the roll. Use serrated lid for clean tearing. Place it over the desired area. Press food wrap along dry rim. Glad Press'n Seal wrap's activated gripping texture tightly seals to almost any dry surface. When using in the microwave, allow at least 1 inch of space between wrap and food. Turn back one corner of food wrap to vent.<br><br>Ingredients: BPA free<br><br>Warnings: Avoid contact with cutting edge. Not for use in conventional or convection ovens, stove tops, toaster ovens or browning units. To prevent wrap from melting, foods high in fat (like bacon) or sugar (like pastries) should not come in contact with plastic wrap in the microwave. When microwaving, turn back one corner of Press'n Seal wrap to vent excess steam. Best when used on clean, dry surfaces. To avoid danger of suffocation or choking, keep this wrap away from babies and children.",

After ants feed on the bait, they return to the colony and transfer the bait to the queen and the others, thereby killing the entire colony.<br><br>DIRECTIONS FOR HOUSEHOLD USE: It is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling. 1. Separate baits before placement. For thorough ant control, use all baits at one time. For larger areas or particularly heavy infestations, we strongly recommend using additional baits. 2. For best results, place baits where you have seen ants including in corners, under sinks, in cabinets and near plumbing fixtures. 3. To secure bait in place, on walls, or under countertops, use removable adhesive. Peel off liner from one side and place adhesive on bottom of station. Apply light pressure for a few seconds. 4. Peel off liner on the other side of the adhesive and secure bait where desired. Surface should be clean, smooth and dry. Apply light pressure for a few seconds. Do not use on wallpaper, unpainted drywall, antiques, or unfinished wood. For other surfaces, test in an inconspicuous area first. 5. Ants will begin eating the bait immediately and you should expect to see fewer ants within days. 6. Replace ALL baits every three months to keep ants from returning.<br><br>USES: Use indoors in corners, along walls and near entry points to kill ants where they hide. For maximum effectiveness, place all baits at the same time. For Household Use: CLOSETS, BASEMENTS, ATTICS, RECREATION ROOMS, LIVING AREAS, KITCHENS, BATHROOMS, DINING ROOMS, PANTRIES, FOOD STORAGE SHELVING, WASTE RECEPTACLES, ETC.",

Providing relief from severe roach problems, killing the roaches you see as well as the ones you don't see with two types of bait.<br><br>DIRECTIONS FOR HOUSEHOLD USE It is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling. For thorough roach control, use all 12 baits at one time. To keep roaches from returning, replace all baits every three months. 1. Break Raid Double Control Small Roach Baits apart before placement. 2. For thorough roach control, all 12 baits must be used at one time. Place 10 baits in the kitchen and 2 in each bathroom. FOR LARGER KITCHENS or PARTICULARLY HEAVY INFESTATIONS, we strongly recommend using additional baits and placing at least 12-15 baits in the kitchen and 2-4 in each bathroom. If you see roaches in other areas, such as the bedroom or utility room, use 2-4 additional baits. 3. For best results, place the baits next to the wall along the baseboards, in corners, under sinks, in cabinets and near plumbing fixtures. You can even place Raid Double Control Small Baits in cabinets. Do not contaminate feed or food products or food preparation surfaces, dishes, kitchen utensils and food containers. 4. Baits work best on horizontal surfaces touching corners and walls. 5. Roaches will begin eating the bait immediately and you should expect to see fewer roaches within days. 6. Replace ALL baits every three months to keep roaches from returning. Use the 3 month reminder on the baits to indicate the date of replacement.<br><br>USES: Use indoors in corners, along walls and near entry points to kill roaches where they hide. For maximum effectiveness, place all baits at the same time. KILLS: Roaches, Palmetto Bugs, Waterbugs",

FOR INDOOR HOUSEHOLD USE: SHAKE WELL BEFORE EACH USE. Hold container upright. Do not spray up into air. Apply to surfaces only. Point spray opening toward surface to be sprayed and press button firmly. Hold about 12\" from surface being sprayed. Spray until surfaces are wet. Avoid excessive wetting of asphalt, tile, rubber and plastic materials. More frequent application will be required to maintain control on plywood surfaces. Repeat treatment as necessary.

During any application to ceilings of a structure, cover surface below with plastic shielding or similar materials. Do not apply this product in a way that will contact any person or pet, either directly or through drift. Keep people and pets out of the area during application. Exit area immediately and remain outside the treated area until sprays have dried. Remove birds and other pets before application. Cover any water inhabited by fish (such as aquariums and ornamental fish ponds) during treatment, and turn aquarium systems off. Do not use water-based sprays in conduits, motor housing, junction boxes, switch boxes, or other electrical equipment because of possible shock hazard. During any indoor surface application, do not allow dripping or runoff to occur. Do not use as a space spray. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Do not use in greenhouses where plants are grown for food. ROACHES, WATERBUGS: Spray until wet in cracks around baseboards and other hiding places. When bugs are driven out, spray directly.

As worker ants forage for food and water, they are immediately attracted to the sweet liquid ant bait housed in the ant stakes. As the ants consume the bait, it begins to deliver a toxic reaction to their nervous systems, which ultimately kills them. However, the ant killer works slowly enough to give the foraging ants enough time to return to their nest and share the deadly bait with the queen and the rest of the colony. The see-through windows in the stakes make it easy to monitor the bait level so you know when it's time to replace them.",

        "description": "Kills Bugs Dead. Raid Roach Gel is an easy way to apply bait, killing all common household roaches at the source. This indoor ready-to-use gel bait starts working in hours as a crack and crevice treatment in areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, basements, and garages.<br><br>DIRECTIONS FOR USE: It is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling. READ THIS LABEL: Read this entire label and follow all use directions and use precautions. Use only for the sites, pests, and application methods described on this label. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Raid Roach Gel is a ready-to-use highly attractive gel bait formulation that is very effective in controlling German and American cockroaches. BEFORE YOU START: Apply to areas not easily accessible to children and pets. Do not apply Raid Roach Gel bait to surfaces recently treated with residual insecticide sprays. Surfaces treated with Raid Roach Gel bait must not be treated with insecticidal sprays, as the bait will be rendered ineffective. Do not apply in or on electrical equipment due to the possibility of shock. Do not apply to surfaces that food contacts. Do not allow open foods to contact gel material. Do not apply in locations of high temperature or direct sunlight. Gel deposits may be cleaned up by using damp paper towel or rag while still wet, or if dried, use putty knife to scrape and discard in trash. May be used indoors as a crack and crevice treatment in and around single and multi-family residential buildings. Apply to areas roaches are commonly found, such as: Under sinks and around plumbing and pipes; to drawers and cabinet corners where roaches are known to hide; equipment legs and bases and behind and under appliances such as ovens, refrigerators, and washers; openings leading into cracks, and hollow spaces in floors, walls, and ceilings; trashcans; behind toilets; baseboards, doors and windows. Do not apply in locations of high temperature or direct sunlight. Inspect bait placements periodically and apply fresh bait as needed. HOW TO APPLY 1. Remove cap to open. 2. Place tube tip at surface to be treated. 3. Gently squeeze tube to create multiple spots of gel about the size of a pea, or apply as a line or strip. When finished, lift tube tip from surface, and replace cap to close. 4. Keep the cap on the tube to prevent gel from drying out. HOW MUCH TO APPLY For spot or gel dot applications: For heavy infestations of roaches, apply 3 to 5 spots of Raid Roach Gel bait per 10 linear feet or one square yard. For light to moderate infestations of roaches, apply 1 - 3 spots of Raid Roach Gel bait per 10 linear feet or one square yard. Each gel dot of Raid Roach Gel applied should be about the size of a pea. To apply a line of gel: For all levels of roach infestations, when a line of Raid Roach Gel bait is used, apply a small thin strip that is less than 1/8 inches wide and approximately 2 inches long. Inspect bait placements periodically and reapply fresh bait as needed.<br><br>USES: Use in hard to reach places like cracks and crevices, in corners, along walls, and near entry points to kill roaches where they hide. Kills: Cockroaches (including German and American) Where to use: In and around homes and other buildings/structures where cockroaches have infested or where they travel to seek food, water or shelter. When to use: When cockroaches are observed or there is evidence of an infestation in/around a home, building or structure.",

        "description": "Flying insects have a way of quickly ruining an afternoon of outdoor fun and relaxation. With little effort, the TERRO Wasp & Fly Trap PLUS Fruit Fly will defend your property against these nuisance pests, so you can get back your peace of mind. This trap utilizes a unique, dual-purpose bait to attract and trap pain-inflicting insects such as wasps, hornets and yellow jackets, while also targeting nuisance flies. It also boasts innovative Trap-n-Trap technology using a secondary bait bottle to attract and trap fruit flies all within the same trap!<br>Since the bait is ready to use, you can have your trap up and ready in no time. In addition, unlike many traditional fly traps, which feature an unpleasant odor, TERRO Wasp & Fly Trap PLUS Fruit Fly bait is stink free! For added effectiveness, this trap boasts a Bug Lock Lid, which prevents insects from escaping after they have entered the trap. For your convenience, this trap is also reusable to allow for continuous insect protection all season long. When the bait bag is full, simply throw it out and insert a new one into the trap!",

A 50 ft 12 V power cord, supplied with the Patriot Plus, allows placement away from the family area yet near the mosquitoes' breeding and resting areas. Lawn clips are provided to help secure your power cord. Through proper placement upwind, the biting insects will be drawn to the trap; thereby reducing the chances of you becoming their target. The heavy-duty plastics and marine grade materials make it ideal for any harsh environments. The enhanced Mosquito Magnet Patriot Plus has been designed for the homeowner who needs to protect up to a 1-acre area. For optimal results, run your trap 24 hours a day in order to break the breeding cycle of the mosquitoes in your yard. Your trap will begin working immediately with noticeable results in 7-10 days allow a 4 week time frame to see significant results. As with the other Mosquito Magnet traps, the Patriot Plus uses the patented CounterFlow Technology to help you protect your family, pets and guests from pesky, biting mosquitoes including those that may carry Zika Virus, West Nile Virus, Encephalitis and other mosquito-borne diseases. The Patriot Plus mimics a human by emitting a plume of carbon dioxide, heat and moisture which when combined with an additional attractant, Octenol or Lurex3, becomes irresistible to mosquitoes and other biting insects. By using one of these approved Mosquito Magnet attractants, you will be able to increase your catch rate up to 10 times. Start protecting your family, pets and guests now from pesky mosquitoes.",

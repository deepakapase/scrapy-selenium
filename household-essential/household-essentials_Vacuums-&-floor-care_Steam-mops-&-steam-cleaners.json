        "description": "The Shark\u00ae Professional Steam Pocket\u00ae Mop featuring Intelligent Steam Control\u00aeoffers superior cleaning and 99.9% sanitization for all of your hard floor surfaces and cleaning needs. Ready to use in 30 seconds, its Intelligent Steam Control\u00ae provides two settings of variable steam with continuous delivery. Select more steam for tough cleaning tasks like stuck-on dirt or heavy-traffic areas, and less steam for everyday cleaning, gentle dusting, or more delicate surfaces. The Shark\u00ae Professional Steam Pocket\u00ae Mop also includes double-side, micro-fiber Steam Pocket\u00ae pads, which allow you to cover twice the cleaning area with a quick flip of the steam head. Plus, its XL water capacity allows you to mop longer without stopping. You can't go wrong with the Shark\u00ae Professional Steam Pocket\u00ae Mop. It delivers the right amount of steam at the perfect temperature to clean, sanitize, and dry in seconds. It leaves surfaces cleaner than a traditional mop-and-bucket, which simply moves dirty water around the floor.",

        "description": "The Polti Vaporetto Focus Steam Cleaner is ideal for those having little time to dedicate to daily cleaning but want clean, hygienic floors. This steam mop is ready in only 30 seconds and thanks to the built-in triangle scrub brush, it reaches even the less accessible corners. Use the supersize two-in-one mop with broad rectangle brush for maximum efficiency for hard floors and carpets. Use the foot lever to detach the triangle brush with scrubbing bristles for hard to reach areas. The removable water tank is transparent and allows for quick and convenient refill. The anti-limescale filter allows you to use tap or distilled water. The Vaporetto Focus can stand alone and comes with a resting mat to use on delicate surfaces while it is still hot. Washable (hand wash only) scrubbing cloth is made of microfibers with scrubbing stripes that help guide the mop on linoleum and other hard surfaces. The other washable (machine washable) microfiber cloth disperses hot steam, picks up debris, and can be used on carpet and hard surfaces.",

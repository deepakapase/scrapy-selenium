Lids easily snap on creating a tight seal and preventing messy spills. Reusable, but also extra sturdy, these containers can be used for keeping fruit salad for a picnic or saving soup in the freezer. Glad Food Storage Containers are just the right size for storing dinner or for sending leftovers home with party guests. BPA free and microwave safe, you can safely heat food in these containers. Clean up is quick and easy because they are dishwasher safe. When you use Glad, you know your food is receiving quality protection.<br><br>Usage Directions: Wash food containers before use. Lock lids together for easy storage by placing one lid on a flat surface and a second lid of the same shape on top. Gently press down on the button in the center of the top lid until you feel the two lids connect. Repeat this process to lock additional lids onto the stack.<br><br>Caution Statements: Glad food containers should not be used for boiling, in ovens, under broilers or on the stove top.

The CrispTray at the bottom of the food container elevates produce away from moisture and promotes airflow to help prevent spoilage. The built-in lid filter never needs to be replaced and will last a lifetime. Use the small storage container for strawberries and grapes and the large storage container for heads of lettuce or whole veggies. Longer lasting produce means fewer trips to the grocery store. *Based on strawberries in FreshWorks\u0099 containers vs. store packaging. Results may vary depending upon produce and use.  2-piece set includes 1 small FreshWorks Produce Saver container with lid (2.5 cup), 1 large FreshWorks Produce Saver container with lid (17.3 cup)",

Sous Vide allows you to precisely control your cooking temperature to achieve perfect results. You can cook sous vide in FoodSaver bags by placing them in water at any temperature up to 195 F (90c). FoodSaver bags and vacuum sealers are ideal for sous vide cooking as they remove all of the air around the food to help lock in flavors and natural juices. FoodSaver pre-cut bags are convenient for quick use and safe for simmering, freezer, refrigerator, and microwave. Specially designed channels block oxygen and moisture to allow complete air removal.

The problem with most sets of storage containers is that they take up precious cupboard space when not in use and usually require lids and bases to be stored separately. This can make pairing the corresponding elements a real hassle. This innovative, space-saving design neatly combines the bases and lids for six sizes of storage container in the same space as one. Bases nest neatly inside each other and lids snap conveniently together making them very easy to find - and all elements are clearly color-coded for speedy pairing. When closed all containers are airtight. All elements are freezer, microwave and dishwasher safe.   Lids are dishwasher safe on top rack only.  BPA-free. Care & Use: Before using in a microwave, remove lid and place loosely on top of container do not close lid. Use caution when removing container from microwave as it may become hot during heating. To prevent staining avoid using with strong colorants such as turmeric or tomato-based sauces. Not suitable for use in ovens or under grills.",

This can make pairing the corresponding elements a real hassle. This innovative, space-saving design neatly combines the bases and lids for four sizes of storage container in the same space as one. Bases nest neatly inside each other and lids snap conveniently together making them very easy to find - and all elements are clearly color-coded for speedy pairing. When closed all containers are airtight. All elements are freezer, microwave and dishwasher safe.   Lids are dishwasher safe on top rack only.  BPA-free. Care & Use: Before using in a microwave, remove lid and place loosely on top of container do not close lid. Use caution when removing container from microwave as it may become hot during heating. To prevent staining avoid using with strong colorants such as turmeric or tomato-based sauces. Not suitable for use in ovens or under grills.",

With tight snapping lids, you have the confidence that those cookies or fruitcake will reach your loved ones still tasting fresh and delicious. Containers are just the right size for storing dinner or for sending leftovers home with party guests. BPA free and microwave safe, you can safely heat food in these containers. Clean up is quick and easy because they are dishwasher safe. Containers and interlocking lids stack neatly to save space in your cabinets. When you use Glad, you know your food is receiving quality protection.<br><br>Usage Directions: Wash food containers before use. Lock lids together for easy storage by placing one lid on a flat surface and a second lid of the same shape on top. Gently press down on the button in the center of the top lid until you feel the two lids connect. Repeat this process to lock additional lids onto the stack.<br><br>Caution Statements: Glad food containers should not be used for boiling, in ovens, under broilers or on the stove top. Before microwaving, remove lid and place loosely on top to vent. Handle all hot containers with care.",

        "description": "Nest storage provides a colourful, space-saving solution to the problem of storing conventional storage containers, which take up precious cupboard space when not in use and requires lids and bases to be stored separately. This clever design allows you to store multiple sizes of containers in the same space as the largest. Container bases nest neatly inside each other and lids snap conveniently together making them very easy to find. All sets feature airtight lids and clear colour coding for easy pairing. This season sees another addition to the range \u2013 a compact 5-piece set that's been designed with family-sized picnics and packed lunches in mind. It features two 8-ounce containers and two 18-ounce containers, which nest neatly inside a large 113-ounce one. The smaller containers are ideal for bite-sized snacks. All elements are freezer, microwave and dishwasher safe.   Lids are dishwasher safe on top rack only.   BPA-free.",

These 1.35oz. leak-resistant sauce containers are built for use in your Bentgo Lunch Box, or with any other on-the-go meal. These convenient dippers are made of food-safe, BPA-free plastic, and can be used over and over again. Bentgo Sauce Containers measure 1.75\" x 1.75\" x 1.5\", and are a great tool for healthier eating and portion control. These containers allow you to bring a small amount of any sauce inside your Bentgo Lunch Box, without taking up too much space. Their compact size and shape make them ideal for dipping - for larger volumes of sauce (such as salad dressing), we suggest packing both containers.",

Obviously it\u2019s great for sushi but fill this with a pasta, couscous or rice salad and you\u2019ll not go hungry. It\u2019s the perfect size for carrying in a hand bag, tote or lap top bag, so you don\u2019t have any excuse for not taking your own lunch with you. The slider divider and sauce pot make it to organize your foods and there is even a convenient \u2018fife\u2019 (fork / knife) included.

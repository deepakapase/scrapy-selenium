Combines garden-fresh scent with plant-derived ingredients and essential oils. Great on all non-porous surfaces such as finished wood and tile floors, countertops, walls, porcelain, bathroom fixtures, sealed natural and synthetic stone, and more. Made in the USA.<br><br>DIRECTIONS FOR USE: Spray on all non-porous surfaces like finished wood and tile floors, countertops, walls, porcelain, bathroom fixtures, sealed stone and granite. Simply wipe away.<br><br>USES: Q. Can I use the Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner on countertops made from granite, marble or quartz? A. Our Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner is safe to use on most stone surfaces, provided the stone surface has been sealed. We do not recommend using this product on unsealed natural stone. Q. Can I use the Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner on wood surfaces? A. When used as directed, our Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner is safe to use on wood surfaces sealed with polyurethane, varnish, or shellac. When dealing with painted wood surfaces or wood furniture with surfaces that could have a compromised seal, such as antique wood furniture, we recommend to first test the Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner in an inconspicuous spot to make sure there is no adverse effect before using the product. Q. Will your Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner disinfect? A. No. Our Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner will not disinfect. The Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner is a very effective cleaner and offers excellent soil and dirt removal, but it does not offer the anti-bacterial benefits of products containing chlorine bleach. When disposed, products containing chlorine bleach are harder on the environment and their fumes also pose a potential health risk to consumers. There also is a growing body of evidence that points to the formation of resistant ?super organisms? due to overuse of anti-bacterial products.",

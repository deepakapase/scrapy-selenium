The colorful silicone bands make it easy to track fluid consumption (wear them as bracelets or roll them up the tumbler each time you refill it), and act as a textured, no-slip grip. The press-in lid has a silicone gasket, so it stays in place; the straw is wide and easy to clean, great for shakes and smoothies. You can also remove the straw and use the lid's built-in stopper to create a spill-proof seal, allowing simple mixing of flavors and powders. The tumbler is made of break-resistant Tritan, with insulating double-wall construction to reduce condensation, and it fits in most car cup holders.",

Using the 50% heavier 12-Gauge\u0099 BlenderBall\u00ae, the Pro45 powers through thicker, higher-volume shakes to ensure a smooth, great-tasting drink. BlenderBottle's patented mixing system is further improved in the Pro45 with the new rounded-base design.

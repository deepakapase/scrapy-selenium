Tide PODS have a built-in stain-fighter that cleans the entire load better than a liquid detergent and in-wash Oxy booster combined. It works in front and top loading washing machines, both regular and high efficiency (HE). Its Ocean Mist Scent infuses your laundry with fresh floral and citrus hints to help leave your laundry smelling great. Just toss one pac for regular loads, two pacs for large loads and three pacs for heavily soiled loads into the washing machine drum before you add clothes to get an amazing clean. Tide PODS are formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power in half the time (1). Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing suds and targets tough stains to remove them quickly. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds. This bag contains 42 laundry pacs. <br>(1) 1 dose of Tide HE Turbo Clean in quick cycle vs. 6 doses of the next leading liquid HE compatible detergent in normal cycle\u00a0",

Woolite Darks has the perfect balance of clean and care, keeping the darks you love vibrant even after 30 washes! Woolite Darks formula contains an active ingredient that acts as a dye magnet that collects loose dye particles during the wash cycle, preventing color transfer & fading so dark colors stay dark for longer!

Tide PODS have a built-in stain fighter that cleans the entire load better than a liquid detergent and in-wash Oxi booster combined. It works in front and top loading washing machines, both regular and high efficiency (HE). Its Original scent infuses your laundry the Tide Original Scent to help leave your laundry smelling great. Just toss one pac for  regular loads, two pacs for large loads and three pacs for heavily soiled loads into the washing machine drum before you add clothes to get an amazing clean. Tide PODS are formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power in half the time (1). Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing suds and targets tough stains to remove them quickly. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds. This tub contains 72 laundry pacs. <br>(1) 1 dose of Tide HE Turbo Clean in quick cycle vs. 6 doses of the next leading liquid HE compatible detergent in normal cycle\u00a0",

Tide PODS Free & Gentle is hypoallergenic to provide amazing clean that is gentle on your skin. Tide PODS have a built-in stain-fighter that cleans the entire load better than a liquid detergent and in-wash Oxi booster combined. It works in front and top loading washing machines, both regular and high efficiency (HE). Just toss one pac for regular loads, two pacs for large loads and three pacs for heavily soiled loads into the washing machine drum before you add clothes to get an amazing clean. Tide PODS are formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power in half the time (1). Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing suds and targets tough stains to remove them quickly. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds. This tub contains 81 laundry pacs.

        "description": "Tide PODS Plus Febreze Sport Odor Defense is a 4-in-1 laundry solution that consists of a laundry detergent, stain remover, color protector, and odor defense technology all in one. The innovative, multi-chamber design separates key ingredients until they hit the wash for optimal cleaning power. They are specifically formulated with Sport Odor Defense technology to fight tough sports odors and stains, like sweat, grass, and dirt in one wash. For small/medium loads, simply place one pac into the washing machine drum before you add clothes, and use two paces for large loads or three paces for extra-large loads. Tide PODS dissolves in any temperature, and can be used in front and top loading washing machines, both standard and high efficiency. For a simple yet effective laundry experience, Tide PODS is the all-in-one solution you've been looking for. Tide PODS is formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power* in half the time. Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing Smart SudsTM while still targeting tough stains. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds. *Stain removal of 1 Tide PODS pac in Quick cycle vs 6 doses of the next leading liquid HE-compatible detergent in Normal cycle\u00a0",

Just toss one pac for  regular loads, two pacs for large loads and three pacs for heavily soiled loads into the washing machine drum before you add clothes to get an amazing clean. Tide PODS are formulated with HE Turbo technology for 6X the cleaning power in half the time (1). Unlike many other HE detergents that can slow washers down because of too many suds, Tide HE Turbo contains quick collapsing suds and targets tough stains to remove them quickly. So you can get amazing results without the extra rinse cycles to remove the suds. This tub contains 57 laundry pacs. <br>(1) 1 dose of Tide HE Turbo Clean in quick cycle vs. 6 doses of the next leading liquid HE compatible detergent in normal cycle\u00a0",

So clothes stay fresh long after you\u2019ve washed them\u2014for 12 weeks from wash to wear. It\u2019s one of many reasons to do a happy dance. <br><br>You know the saying \"spring is in the air\"? It means the birds are chirping, the flowers are blooming, the sky is blue and everything smells so fresh and lovely. That's pretty much what happens when you open this bottle. Except maybe for the chirping birds.",

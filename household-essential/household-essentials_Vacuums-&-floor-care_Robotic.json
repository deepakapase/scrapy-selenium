        "description": "With the BLACK+DECKER\u0099 HRV425BL SMARTECH\u0099 Cordless Lithium Robotic Vacuum, Keeping Up Just Got Easier\u0099.  The extra large dustbin (1 Liter) holds 2X more debris than the competition so you can clean more between empties.  With an extra-wide cleaning path and up to 90 minutes of runtime, this robotic vacuum keeps crumbs, allergens and dirt under control.  The LED top cover flashes troubleshooting alerts to display the source of errors or maintenance needs, eliminating guesswork.  AUTOSENSE\u0099 automatically adjusts suction power from hard floors to carpet, so you get more power when you need it and long battery life too.  This robot vacuum automatically docks and recharges, so its ready for the next cleaning and its sensors detect stairs and other drop-offs.  2 side sweepers clean dust and debris along edges and in corners in addition to the extra wide 9\" beater bar that snaps in and out for easy maintenance.  You can select from 3 cleaning modes to fit your needs: Spot Clean, Quick, and Auto or choose manual drive for full control of the cleaning area.  Conveniently control and schedule your vacuum or personalize the illuminated LED cover to match your color style with the free BLACK+DECKER smartphone app.  This vacuum has Bluetooth capability.  Kit includes: (1) Lithium Robot vacuum, (1) Charging Base, (4) Side Sweepers, (2) HEPA Filters, (1) Multi-Purpose Beater Bar, (1) Beater Bar Cleaning Tool, and (1) Screwdriver.  1 Year Limited Warranty.",
